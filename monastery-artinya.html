                                            It has been documented that, almost twelve million years ago at the beginning ofthe Pilocene Age, a horse, about midway through its evolutionary development,crossed a land brigde where the Bering Straits are now located, from Alaska intothe grasslands of Europe.The horse was the Hipparion, about the size of a modern-day pony with threetoes and specialized cheek teeth for grazing.In Europe the Hipparion encountered another less advanced horse, called theAnchitheres, which had previously invaded Europe by the same route, probablyduring the Miocene Period.Less developed and smaller than the Hipparion , the Anchitheres was completelyreplaced by it.By the end of Pleistocene Age both the Anchitheres and the Hipparion hadbecome extinct in North America, where they had originated. In Europe they hadevolved into an animal very similar to the horse as we know it today.It was the descendant of this horse that was brought by the European coloniststo the America.13 Which of the following conclusions may be made on the basis of information inthe passage?A The Hipparion migrated to Europe to feed in developing grasslands.B There are no fossil remains of either the Anchitheres or the Hipparion.C There were horses in North America when the first European colonists arrived.D Very little is known about the evolution of the horse.14 According to this passage, th Hipparions wereA Five-toed animalsB Not as highly developed as the AnchitheresC Larger than the AnchitheresD About the size of a small dog15 Both the Hipparion and the AnchitheresA Were the size of a modern ponyB Were native to North AmericaC Migrated to Europe in the Pliocene PeriodD Had unspecialized teeth16 A monk lives in a .A CoventB MonasteryC CellD Palace​</a>

A Woman and the Bell of Miidera
In the ancient monastery of Miidera there was a great bronze bell. It rang out every morning and evening, a clear, rich note, and its surface shone like sparkling dew. The priests would not allow any woman to strike it, because they thought that such an action would pollute and dull the metal, as well as bring calamity upon them.
 	When a certain pretty woman who lived in Kyoto heard this, she grew extremely inquisitive, and at last, unable to restrain her curiosity, she said: "I will go and see this wonderful bell of Miidera. I will make it send forth a soft note, and in its shining surface, bigger and brighter than a thousand mirrors, I will paint and powder my face and dress my hair."
	At length this vain and irreverent woman reached the belfry in which the great bell was suspended, at a time when all were absorbed in their sacred duties. She looked into the gleaming bell and saw her pretty eyes, flushed cheeks, and laughing dimples. Presently she stretched forth her little fingers, lightly touched the shining metal, and prayed that she might have as great and splendid a mirror for her own. When the bell felt this woman's fingers, the bronze that she touched shrank, leaving a little hollow, and losing at the same time all its exquisite polish.</a>

WHEN I WALK around New York City in my gray monastic robes, I often encounter little boys who imitate Bruce Lee upon seeing me. At first I didn't understand what they were doing, but soon enough I did they assumed anyone with a shaved head, wearing robes, would know martial arts. I thought this was cute and amusing. A more forward boy even asked me if I knew kung fu like those Chinese monks at Shaolin Temple. The playful side of me wanted to make a few fake kung fu poses, slowly raising my arms and my right leg.
When adults find out that I am a Buddhist monastic, they ask with curiosity, "What kind of meditation do you practice?" or "How many hours do you sit every morning? Your mind must be very peaceful." Then they talk about their experiences at a local Zen center or yoga studio, or tell me about a book on mindfulness they have come across. For many adults in the West, it seems that a Buddhist teacher is someone who is serene and collected thanks to daily meditation. Although the assumptions of the child and the adult are different, I find that there is an underlying similarity. Both child and adult are curious about what it is that a monk does. In other words, when it comes to imagining a monk's identity, people in the West tend to zero in on his behavior.
When I am in Korea, a different set of questions awaits me. On the subway, for instance, the person sitting next to me might ask, "Where is your home monastery?" or "Which temple do you currently reside in?" For Koreans it appears that the most defining part of a person is where he lives. Even in the U.S., when Koreans first meet, after exchanging names the first question they ask is, "Where in Korea are you from?" It seems that for many Koreans, one's
identity is tied closely to his hometown rather than to what he is doing. Every time I return to Korea, I wonder why Koreans are so obsessed with their alma mater, even when they are over fifty years old. Of course, when it comes to finding a job, having graduated from a prestigious university is advantageous in most parts of the world. But the degree alone is often not
[9/2 09.35] Lot keluahen Sinambela: enough. Even if one has landed a good job, one's skills and experience are more important than where one has studied. A good example is Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple. Jobs went to Reed College but dropped out after one semester. Anyone familiar with American higher education would know that Reed is an excellent liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon. But to an average Korean, who has heard only of the Ivy League and a few large universities in California, Reed would be considered subpar. If Steve Jobs had been Korean, his educational background would have been a huge impediment to a successful career. Nobody would have taken his ideas seriously or invested in his company; be would have been seen as not smart enough to have gone to an Ivy.
This concerns me. If we consider someone's identity as rooted primarily in his hometown or the school he graduated from, we end up looking only at his past and not paying attention to his current skills or future vision. Only those born into good families with the right educational background and connections are given a chance to succeed, while those from less-than-ideal backgrounds who are brimming with potential are denied opportunities.
Whenever young boys approach me to ask if I know kung fu, it becomes an occasion for me to reflect on my life. Am I behaving like a spiritual teacher? Or have I become complacent in my identity and ignored the work I am called to do? Moreover, when I meet someone new, do I make an effort to see who he is beneath his social markers? Or am I reducing people to their background and failing to see who they really are? I am reminded again that anyone, including those young boys, can be our spiritual teacher if we are willing to open our hearts to them.
Life is like a slice of pizza.
It looks delicious in an advertisement. but when we actually have it, it is not as good as we imagined.
If you envy someone's life, remember the pizza in the ad.
It always looks better than it is.
Have you ever selected a cheaper dish from a menu than the one you really wanted, only to regret your choice when it arrived? Always go with your first choice if you can afford it.
It is better than a life filled with regrets.

                                            Text for questions 4 to 9. The Songkran festival is celebrated in Thailand as the traditional New Year's Day. It is celebrated from 13 to 15 April. It coincides with the New Year of many calendars of South and Southeast Asian countries. It is believed to have been adapted from the Sankranti Hindu festival. It is now observed nationwide even in the far south. However, the most famous Songkran celebrations are still in-the--northern--city of Chiang Mai, where it lasts for six days and even longer. It has also become a party for foreigners and an additional reason for tourists to visit Thailand. The most obvious celebration of Songkran is the throwing of water to other people. Thais roam the streets with containers of water or water guns. In addition, many Thais will have small bowls of cheap beige coloured talc and mixed with water which is then smeared on the faces and bodies of random passersby as a blessing for the new year. City officials close off many sections of the street for the festival. Besides the throwing of water, people celebrate Songkran by going to a wat (Buddhist monastery) to pray and give food to monks. They also cleanse Buddha images in the household shrines as well as Buddha images at monasteries by gently pouring water mixed with a Thai fragrance over them. It is believed that doing this will bring good luck and prosperity in the New Year. In many cities, such as Chiang Mart of Buddha images from all of the city's important monasteries are paraded through the streets so that people can toss water at them, ritually "bathing' the images as they pass. ​</a>

                                            La Verna Sanctuary is perched in an amazing setting in the forest on a high rocky promontory, visible from a distance. The sanctuary sits on the site where it's believed that Saint Francis received the stigmata. It's now a monastic complex that includes the monastery, church, museum, chapels, and the cave that was his cell as well as tourist facilities including a souvenir shop and refreshment bar. From the sanctuary, there are fantastic views of the valleys below.
Santa Maria Degli Angeli, a small church founded by Saint Francis, was built on this spot in 1216. In 1224, Saint Francis came to the mountain and little church for one of his retreats and it was then that he received the stigmata. La Verna became an important pilgrimage site for Franciscans and followers of Saint Francis and a large monastery developed.
The larger Church of Saint Mary was consecrated in 1568 and holds a number of important Della Robbia art works. Masses are held in the church several times a day starting at 8 am. The sanctuary itself is open from 6:30 AM until sunset although the museum has shorter hours.
In 1263, a small chapel was built over the spot where Saint Francis received the stigmata. It's reached by a long corridor with frescoes depicting the life of Saint Francis and bas-reliefs of the Via Crucis. The friars walk along this route to the chapel daily as they have since 1341.
Above the Sanctuary - La Penna
From the convent, you can walk up to La Penna, the highest point on the mountain, where there's a chapel built on a precipice. From La Penna, the countryside is visible for miles around and the views take in valleys in three regions - Tuscany, Umbria, and the Marche. On the way to La Penna, you'll pass Sasso di Lupo, the rock of the wolf, a large rock split away from the rocky mass and the cell of the Blessed Giovanni Della Verna, who died in 1322.
Write down the sentence that shows these information(write exactly as it is written in the text in a full sentence!) 
1. La Penna is located on a place higher than La Verna.
2. La Verna Sanctuary is on the high ground.
3. Saint Francis had the same wound like Jesus.

                                            Who does not know Borobudur? This Buddist temple has 1460 relief panels and 504 Buddha effigies in its complex. Millions of people are eager to visit this building as one of the world wonder heritages. It is not surprising since architecturally and functionally, as the place for Buddist to say their prayer, Borobudur is attractive.           Borobudur was built by King Samarottungga, one of the kings of old Mataram kingdom, the descendant of sailendra dynasty. Based on Kayumwungan inscription, an Indonesian named Hudaya Kandahjaya revealed that Borobudur was a place for praying that was completed to be built in 824,almost one hundred years from the time the construction was begun. The name of Borobudurs  ,as some people say,means a mountain having terraces (buddhara), while other says that Borobudur means monastery of the high place.           Borobudur was constructed as aten terraces building. The height before being renovated was 42 meters and 34.5 after the renovation because the lowest level was used as supporting base.The first six terraces are in square form,two upper terraces are in circular form and in the top of them is the terace where Buddha statue is located facing westward.each terrace symbolizes the stage of human life.What does the text tell us about?</a>

A Woman and the Bell of Miidera
In the ancient monastery of Miidera there was a great bronze bell. It rang out every morning and evening, a clear, rich note, and its surface shone like sparkling dew. The priests would not allow any woman to strike it, because they thought that such an action would pollute and dull the metal, as well as bring calamity upon them.
 	When a certain pretty woman who lived in Kyoto heard this, she grew extremely inquisitive, and at last, unable to restrain her curiosity, she said: "I will go and see this wonderful bell of Miidera. I will make it send forth a soft note, and in its shining surface, bigger and brighter than a thousand mirrors, I will paint and powder my face and dress my hair."
	At length this vain and irreverent woman reached the belfry in which the great bell was suspended, at a time when all were absorbed in their sacred duties. She looked into the gleaming bell and saw her pretty eyes, flushed cheeks, and laughing dimples. Presently she stretched forth her little fingers, lightly touched the shining metal, and prayed that she might have as great and splendid a mirror for her own. When the bell felt this woman's fingers, the bronze that she touched shrank, leaving a little hollow, and losing at the same time all its exquisite polish.</h2><br />
                        Seorang Wanita dan Bell dari Miidera

 

Di biara kuno Miidera ada lonceng perunggu besar. Ini
terdengar setiap pagi dan sore, sebuah, catatan kaya jelas, dan permukaannya
bersinar seperti embun berkilauan. Para imam tidak akan membiarkan seorang
wanita untuk menyerang, karena mereka berpikir bahwa tindakan seperti itu akan
mencemari dan kusam logam, serta membawa bencana atas mereka.

 

Ketika seorang wanita cantik tertentu yang tinggal di Kyoto
mendengar ini, ia tumbuh sangat ingin tahu, dan akhirnya, dapat menahan rasa
ingin tahunya, dia berkata: "Aku akan pergi dan melihat lonceng ini indah
Miidera saya akan membuatnya memancarkan lembut. catatan, dan di permukaannya
bersinar, besar dan lebih cerah dari seribu cermin, saya akan melukis dan bedak
dan berpakaian rambut saya. "

 

 

 

Akhirnya wanita yang sia-sia dan sopan ini mencapai menara
tempat lonceng bergantung di mana lonceng besar dihentikan, pada saat semua
diserap dalam tugas suci mereka. Dia melihat ke bel berkilauan dan melihat
matanya cukup, pipi memerah, dan tertawa lesung. Saat ia mengulurkan jari
kecilnya, ringan menyentuh logam bersinar, dan berdoa bahwa ia mungkin memiliki
sebagai besar dan splendid cermin untuknya sendiri. Ketika bel merasa jari
wanita ini, perunggu bahwa dia menyentuh menyusut, meninggalkan sedikit
berongga, dan kehilangan pada saat yang sama semua cat indah nya.<br />

                            12. 
WHEN I WALK around New York City in my gray monastic robes, I often encounter little boys who imitate Bruce Lee upon seeing me. At first I didn't understand what they were doing, but soon enough I did they assumed anyone with a shaved head, wearing robes, would know martial arts. I thought this was cute and amusing. A more forward boy even asked me if I knew kung fu like those Chinese monks at Shaolin Temple. The playful side of me wanted to make a few fake kung fu poses, slowly raising my arms and my right leg.
When adults find out that I am a Buddhist monastic, they ask with curiosity, "What kind of meditation do you practice?" or "How many hours do you sit every morning? Your mind must be very peaceful." Then they talk about their experiences at a local Zen center or yoga studio, or tell me about a book on mindfulness they have come across. For many adults in the West, it seems that a Buddhist teacher is someone who is serene and collected thanks to daily meditation. Although the assumptions of the child and the adult are different, I find that there is an underlying similarity. Both child and adult are curious about what it is that a monk does. In other words, when it comes to imagining a monk's identity, people in the West tend to zero in on his behavior.
When I am in Korea, a different set of questions awaits me. On the subway, for instance, the person sitting next to me might ask, "Where is your home monastery?" or "Which temple do you currently reside in?" For Koreans it appears that the most defining part of a person is where he lives. Even in the U.S., when Koreans first meet, after exchanging names the first question they ask is, "Where in Korea are you from?" It seems that for many Koreans, one's
identity is tied closely to his hometown rather than to what he is doing. Every time I return to Korea, I wonder why Koreans are so obsessed with their alma mater, even when they are over fifty years old. Of course, when it comes to finding a job, having graduated from a prestigious university is advantageous in most parts of the world. But the degree alone is often not
[9/2 09.35] Lot keluahen Sinambela: enough. Even if one has landed a good job, one's skills and experience are more important than where one has studied. A good example is Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple. Jobs went to Reed College but dropped out after one semester. Anyone familiar with American higher education would know that Reed is an excellent liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon. But to an average Korean, who has heard only of the Ivy League and a few large universities in California, Reed would be considered subpar. If Steve Jobs had been Korean, his educational background would have been a huge impediment to a successful career. Nobody would have taken his ideas seriously or invested in his company; be would have been seen as not smart enough to have gone to an Ivy.
This concerns me. If we consider someone's identity as rooted primarily in his hometown or the school he graduated from, we end up looking only at his past and not paying attention to his current skills or future vision. Only those born into good families with the right educational background and connections are given a chance to succeed, while those from less-than-ideal backgrounds who are brimming with potential are denied opportunities.
Whenever young boys approach me to ask if I know kung fu, it becomes an occasion for me to reflect on my life. Am I behaving like a spiritual teacher? Or have I become complacent in my identity and ignored the work I am called to do? Moreover, when I meet someone new, do I make an effort to see who he is beneath his social markers? Or am I reducing people to their background and failing to see who they really are? I am reminded again that anyone, including those young boys, can be our spiritual teacher if we are willing to open our hearts to them.
Life is like a slice of pizza.
It looks delicious in an advertisement. but when we actually have it, it is not as good as we imagined.
If you envy someone's life, remember the pizza in the ad.
It always looks better than it is.
Have you ever selected a cheaper dish from a menu than the one you really wanted, only to regret your choice when it arrived? Always go with your first choice if you can afford it.
It is better than a life filled with regrets.

                            13. Text for questions 4 to 9. The Songkran festival is celebrated in Thailand as the traditional New Year's Day. It is celebrated from 13 to 15 April. It coincides with the New Year of many calendars of South and Southeast Asian countries. It is believed to have been adapted from the Sankranti Hindu festival. It is now observed nationwide even in the far south. However, the most famous Songkran celebrations are still in-the--northern--city of Chiang Mai, where it lasts for six days and even longer. It has also become a party for foreigners and an additional reason for tourists to visit Thailand. The most obvious celebration of Songkran is the throwing of water to other people. Thais roam the streets with containers of water or water guns. In addition, many Thais will have small bowls of cheap beige coloured talc and mixed with water which is then smeared on the faces and bodies of random passersby as a blessing for the new year. City officials close off many sections of the street for the festival. Besides the throwing of water, people celebrate Songkran by going to a wat (Buddhist monastery) to pray and give food to monks. They also cleanse Buddha images in the household shrines as well as Buddha images at monasteries by gently pouring water mixed with a Thai fragrance over them. It is believed that doing this will bring good luck and prosperity in the New Year. In many cities, such as Chiang Mart of Buddha images from all of the city's important monasteries are paraded through the streets so that people can toss water at them, ritually "bathing' the images as they pass. ​</h2><br />

                            17. La Verna Sanctuary is perched in an amazing setting in the forest on a high rocky promontory, visible from a distance. The sanctuary sits on the site where it's believed that Saint Francis received the stigmata. It's now a monastic complex that includes the monastery, church, museum, chapels, and the cave that was his cell as well as tourist facilities including a souvenir shop and refreshment bar. From the sanctuary, there are fantastic views of the valleys below.
Santa Maria Degli Angeli, a small church founded by Saint Francis, was built on this spot in 1216. In 1224, Saint Francis came to the mountain and little church for one of his retreats and it was then that he received the stigmata. La Verna became an important pilgrimage site for Franciscans and followers of Saint Francis and a large monastery developed.
The larger Church of Saint Mary was consecrated in 1568 and holds a number of important Della Robbia art works. Masses are held in the church several times a day starting at 8 am. The sanctuary itself is open from 6:30 AM until sunset although the museum has shorter hours.
In 1263, a small chapel was built over the spot where Saint Francis received the stigmata. It's reached by a long corridor with frescoes depicting the life of Saint Francis and bas-reliefs of the Via Crucis. The friars walk along this route to the chapel daily as they have since 1341.
Above the Sanctuary - La Penna
From the convent, you can walk up to La Penna, the highest point on the mountain, where there's a chapel built on a precipice. From La Penna, the countryside is visible for miles around and the views take in valleys in three regions - Tuscany, Umbria, and the Marche. On the way to La Penna, you'll pass Sasso di Lupo, the rock of the wolf, a large rock split away from the rocky mass and the cell of the Blessed Giovanni Della Verna, who died in 1322.
Write down the sentence that shows these information(write exactly as it is written in the text in a full sentence!) 
1. La Penna is located on a place higher than La Verna.
2. La Verna Sanctuary is on the high ground.
3. Saint Francis had the same wound like Jesus.
4. There's a place named after a ferocious creature.
5. The place is somehow a wide area with a lot of places to visit.</h2><br />

                            18. Who does not know Borobudur? This Buddist temple has 1460 relief panels and 504 Buddha effigies in its complex. Millions of people are eager to visit this building as one of the world wonder heritages. It is not surprising since architecturally and functionally, as the place for Buddist to say their prayer, Borobudur is attractive.           Borobudur was built by King Samarottungga, one of the kings of old Mataram kingdom, the descendant of sailendra dynasty. Based on Kayumwungan inscription, an Indonesian named Hudaya Kandahjaya revealed that Borobudur was a place for praying that was completed to be built in 824,almost one hundred years from the time the construction was begun. The name of Borobudurs  ,as some people say,means a mountain having terraces (buddhara), while other says that Borobudur means monastery of the high place.           Borobudur was constructed as aten terraces building. The height before being renovated was 42 meters and 34.5 after the renovation because the lowest level was used as supporting base.The first six terraces are in square form,two upper terraces are in circular form and in the top of them is the terace where Buddha statue is located facing westward.each terrace symbolizes the stage of human life.What does the text tell us about?</h2><br />
