                            2. story telling cinderella singkat dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>CINDERELLA</strong><br /></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a girl 
called Cinderella. she was happy live with her father and mother. until 
her mother died dead and her father had married a widow with two 
daughters. Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two 
daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to 
work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a 
while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her 
Cinderella.</p>
<p>Cinderella used to spend long hours all 
alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really 
meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and
 that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old 
rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid 
and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always 
would be.</p>
<p>One day, beautiful new dresses arrived 
at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters 
were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could 
go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re 
staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the 
beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. 
Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured 
“Miaow.”</p>





<p>Suddenly something amazing happened. As 
Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy
 appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you 
would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in 
rags?” Cinderella replied.</p>
<p>The fairy smiled. With a flick of her 
magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she
 had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would
 never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” 
said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, 
bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”</p>
<p>Cinderella soon returned with the 
pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a 
flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and 
the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a 
coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly
 believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. 
But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. 
Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice
 again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these 
glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I 
understand!”</p>
<p>Cinderella had a wonderful time at the 
ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what 
the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the 
Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her 
slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! 
If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that 
would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was now madly in love 
with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and 
search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will 
never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper 
on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved 
her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, 
shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at 
her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The 
Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived 
happily ever.</p><p>Semoga membantu!!!<br /></p><br /><br />

                            3. Story telling Cinderella singkat (4 paragraf)​</h2><br />
                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Cinderella lives with her mother and two stepsisters</p><p> Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p><p> She lives with her two stepsisters and a stepmother.  They didn't like Cinderella at all.  Cinderella was always told to do many things.  Starting from cooking, washing, mopping, and all other household chores are done by Cinderella alone.</p><p> Because she continues to work, Cinderella can only be friends with rats hiding in her house.  The rats were afraid that the cat's pet stepmother would hunt them.</p><p> One day, a guard from the kingdom came to the village.  He announced that there would be a party to find a wife for the prince.  It made all the girls in the village feel good, including Cinderella.  However, the two stepsisters and stepmother did not like it when Cinderella joined the party.</p><p> When the night of the party arrived, the stepmother gave Cinderella a lot of work.  Of course, so that Cinderella didn't have time to come to the party.  However, Cinderella was determined, she would still come to the event.  All of his work was completed quickly.</p><p> “This is a royal event.  Are you going to wear your old clothes? "  sneered the stepmother.</p><p> Cinderella became sad.  What her stepmother said was true, she could not have come to the party with her old clothes on.  Finally, the two stepbrothers and stepmother left without Cinderella.  Cinderella could only cry sadly in the backyard.</p><p> Meanwhile, at the palace, a party is underway to find a future wife for the prince.  However, it seemed that none of the girls were able to attract the prince's attention.  Likewise with Cinderella's two stepsisters, they were unable to attract the prince.</p><p> The Prince's Party in the Palace</p><p> Cinderella was still crying behind the house. Suddenly ...</p><p> Clingg!  Olala, her tears turned into a fairy.</p><p> "Why are you sad, Cinderella?"  asked the fairy.</p><p> Cinderella explained everything.  Hearing Cinderella's explanation, the fairy became pity.  He also intends to help Cinderella.</p><p> "Take a pumpkin, and call your mouse friends," pleaded the fairy.</p><p> Without wasting time, Cinderella obeyed the fairy orders.  With her magic wand, the fairy turns the pumpkin into a very beautiful horse carriage.  As for the mice, they were turned into bodyguards.  Cinderella herself, was turned into a princess.  Really, Cinderella looks very beautiful.  She was wearing a very beautiful dress and glass slipper.</p><p> "Remember, Cinderella.  My magic only lasts until midnight.  So, before twelve o'clock at night you have to go home, "said the fairy when he let Cinderella go.</p><p> Cinderella nodded in understanding.  He immediately went to the prince's palace using his pump train.  Arriving at the palace, the prince saw Cinderella.</p><p> "What a beautiful girl," murmured the prince.</p><p> Prince walked closer to Cinderella.  Olala, he asked Cinderella to dance.  How happy Cinderella.  He also danced with the prince.</p><p> Imperceptibly, it was almost twelve in the evening.  It was twelve in the evening, the clock in the palace chimed loudly.  Cinderella immediately remembered the fairy message.  He also said goodbye to the prince.</p><p> Prince tries to prevent Cinderella.  But too late, Cinderella was already running fast to the pump train.  However, while running, Cinderella's glass slipper accidentally fell.  The prince picked up the glass slipper, and stared sadly at Cinderella's departure.</p><p> After the ball, the prince became gloomy.  He is sad because he can't find the girl he loves, who is none other than Cinderella.  Knowing the prince's sadness, the king made a contest.  Anyone whose foot size fits the glass slipper is the girl who is sought.</p><p> The prince, accompanied by his guards, came to the houses of residents who had girls.  But, of the many girls who try glass shoes, not one girl has the right foot size.  The prince almost gave up.</p><p> The prince entered the last house, namely Cinderella's house. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother and two siblings did not allow Cinderella to try on the glass slipper.  They gave Cinderella a lot of work behind the house.  That way, the prince didn't know that there was another girl in the house.</p><p> Cinderella's two stepsisters also tried the glass slipper, but it still didn't fit.</p><p> "Where else to look for that girl, Prince?"  asked the bodyguard.</p><p> "I don't know either.  Maybe we won't be able to find the girl, "replied the prince sadly.</p><p> Suddenly, there was a very melodious singing from behind Cinderella's house.  The prince was curious.  He looked for the origin of the voice.</p><p></p><br />

                        Etymology[edit]<p>Previously, Tulungagung was only a small area located surrounding a location where the center of the town is situated now. That area was named Tulungagung, because it provided a great water source - in Old Javaneselanguage, tulung means water source, and agung means big. The larger area are called Ngrowo.

                        pada saat itu saya pergi ke tempat yg banya orang untuk mencari saudara saya yg pergi dari rumah beberapa tahun yg laluOne day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br />Maaf kalau salah :)<br />

                        Lion was very proud and very vain.  He loved to stomp around the savannah, roaring and growling whenever he saw his animal subjects - Giraffe or Hyena or Elephant or Gazelle or Ape - to show what a mighty Lion he was. <br /><br />"I am a Very Mighty King!" he roared.  And his subjects all bowed low before him. <br /><br />One day, Lion looked into the mirror-like waters of the lake.  He was struck by his own greatness.  What a beautiful and noble creature I am, he thought. <br /><br />"I am a Very Mighty King!" he roared.  "I am a Very Mighty King!" <br /><br />Lion preened and posed and pranced in front of the glassy lake for hours, admiring his greatness.  Finally, Lion said:  "I will show my devoted subjects that their leader is every inch a King." <br /><br />Lion put on his fancy robes, his jeweled crown, and all his gold and silver medals.  His clothes were very heavy, but they made him look mighty and grand. <br /><br />"I am a Very Mighty King!" he roared in delight. "I am a Very Mighty King!"<br /><br />Lion sent out a message to all his animal subjects - to Giraffe and Hyena and Elephant and Gazelle and Ape.  He sent messages to all the animals living on the savannah or in the junge, inviting them to a meeting on the parade grounds in front of his palace, where they could admire him in his finery. <br /><br />And so the animals came to see Lion; the Giraffe and the Hyena and the Elephant and the Gazelle and the Ape.  And many more animals came as well; from the stately Zebra in his black-and-white coat to the teeny, tiny Beetle, who was so little that he had to walk on the side fo the road so the bigger anmals would not step on him by accidents. <br /><br />"I am small.  I am little.  People look down and can't see me," sang the Beetle as he scurried through the tall grass beside the road. "I am small.  I am little.  But inside, I'm tall as a tree!" <br /><br />When the animals were assembled on the parade ground, there came a mighty trumpet blast from Elephant, and Lion came forth in all his grandeur. <br /><br />"I am a Very Mighty King!" he roared. "I am a Very Mighty King!" <br /><br />Lion strutted and preened and pranced before his animal subjects.  The animals were awed by his splendor and bowed before him.  Lion stomped through the rows of Elephants and Giraffes and Hyenas and Gazelles, roaring and growling to show how mighty he was. <br /><br />"I am a Very Mighty King!" he roared. "I am a Very Mighty King!"<br /><br />Then Lion saw the teeny tiny Beetle, standing alone by the side of the road.  The Beetle was singing to himself as he watched the Lion.  "I am small. I am little. People look down and can't see me," sang the Beetle as Lion strutted before his subjects. "I am small. I am little. But inside, I'm tall as a tree!"<br /><br />Lion said to the Beetle:  "You, Beetle, bow before me!" <br /><br />Beetle said:  "Your Royal Majesty, I know that I am small, but if you look at me closely, you will see that I ammaking a bow!" <br /><br />Lion replied:  "Beetle, you are hard to see down there!  I am not sure that you are bowing to me." <br /><br />Beetle said:  "Look at me closely.  I assure you that I am bowing." <br /><br />Lion leaned over, peering down at the teeny tiny Beetle.  His splendid robes, his jeweled crown and his many medals made him so top-heavy that Lion wobbled and swayed as he loomed over the teeny tiny Beetle.  Then Lion lost his balance and fell onto his head!  His royal crown went flying off, and Lion rolled over and over, down the steep hill, and plopped into a ditch filled with muddy water. <br /><br />All the animals laughed and laughed when they saw the muddy Lion sprawled in the ditch.  Frightened, the teeny tiny Beetle scurried away.  And the bedraggled Lion scurried away too.  He was not so very mighty, after all.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Moral: It is the high and mighty who have the longest distance to fall. <br /><br />The Lion and The Beetle<br />

But then, Prambanan kingdom was attacked and occupied by the Pengging kingdom. Prambanan then was ruled by Bandung Bondowoso of Pengging kingdom. He was a mean king.

Bandung Bondowoso fell in love with her and wanted to marry her. “You’re very beautiful. Would you be my queen?” asked Bandung Bondowoso. Loro Jonggrang was shocked. She didn’t like Bandung Bondowoso because he was a mean person. She wanted to refuse, but she afraid that Bandung Bondowoso would be angry and endangered the people of Prambanan. Then, she came up with a plan. “If you want to marry me, you have to build a thousand temples for me in just one night,” said Loro Jonggrang. “What? That’s impossible!” said Bandung Bondowoso. But he did not give up. He consulted with his advisor. “Your Majesty can asked the genies to help built the temples,” said the advisor.<br />So, Bandung Bondowoso summoned his entire genies soldier and commanded them to help him built a thousand temples. The genies worked in unbelievable speed. Meanwhile, Loro Jonggrang heard from her servant that the building of a thousand temples was almost finished. She was so worried. But again, she came up with a great idea. She asked all of her servants to help her. “Please prepare a lot of straw and mortar. Please hurry up!” said Loro Jonggrang. “Burn the straw and make some noise pounding the mortar, quickly.” All those servants did what Loro Jonggrang ordered them; burning straw and pounding the mortar, making the genies think that the sun is going to rise.<br />“It’s already dawn. We have to go,” said the leader of the genies to Bandung Bondowoso. All the genies immediately stopped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they afraid of. They didn’t know that the light was from the fire that burning the straw, not from the sun.<br />Bandung Bondowoso can’t stop the genies from leaving. He was angry. He knew Loro Jonggrang had just tricked him. “You cannot fool me, Loro Jonggrang. I already have 999 temples. I just need one more temple. Now, I will make you the one-thousandth temple.” He pointed his finger to Loro Jonggrang and said some mantras. Magically, Loro Jonggrang’s body turned into stone. Until now, the temple is still standing in Prambanan area, Central Java. And the temple is called Loro Jonggrang temple.<br /><br />Ini doang cerita rakyat yang paling singkat yg lainnya minimal 5 paragraph<br />

At the base south of the sea, the ocean which first called the Indian Ocean, South of Java Island, she governed a royal delicate creature kingdom that is very large and beautiful.<br /><br />According to the story, long time ago, there is a beautiful woman, named Kadita. For her beauty, she was often called Dewi Srengenge, which means the fairest Sun. Kadita is a daughter of king Munding Wangi. Although Kadita has very beautiful face, the king was still upset because he did not have a son who can be prepared for being the next king. After the king got married with Dewi Mutiara, there was born a baby boy. However, after getting much attention, Dewi Mutiara started asking many demands, such as making sure their children will be the man who will replace the king and the Dewi Kadita must be expelled from the palace. The first request was fulfilled, but the King was not willing to expel Dewi Kadita.<br /><br />“I can’t accept it!”, Dewi Mutiara said.<br /><br />“I can’t fulfil your evil request.” The king said.<br /><br />Knowing the answer of the king, Dewi Mutiara smiled sweetly, so that the king’s anger is slowly disappeared. But, she had a revenge in her heart.<br /><br />The next morning, Dewi Mutiara asked her babysitter to call a witch. His name was Jahil. She commanded him to send witchcraft to Dewi Kadita. Jahil accepted he command. When Dewi Kadita was sleeping tightly, wind entered her room. The wind smelt bad, like carcase. When Kadit woke up, she was shocked that her body was full of scab and it smelt bad.<br /><br />The King Munding Wangi heard that news. He was really sad. He knew that what Kadita suffered was not a common disease but that was witchcraft. He assumed that Dewi Mutiara who planned it. However, it was difficult to prove.

Due to the insistence of his advisor, her daughter had to be banished in order not to be a disgrace.<br /><br />Then, Kadita went alone like a beggar who was shoed from rich people’s house. Her heart was broken. She cried. But, she still believed that God would not let her be abused by the others. God’s help would come soon and she was not allowed to hate and have revenge in her heart as her grandmother ever told her.<br /><br />Night and day, she walked and it was already the seventh night that she went through until she arrived at South Sea Beach. She stood up and saw the breadth of the sea and she was like hearing a voice who asked her to go into the sea. When she followed that voice and her body touched the water, her body was recovered.

                        <p>Pengertian Tenses Bahasa Inggris</p><p>Ketika belajar menggunakan bahasa Inggris yang baik dan benar, tenses menjadi suatu hal mendasar dan sangat penting untuk dipelajari. Salah satu komponen berbahasa tersebut pada umumnya digunakan sebagai pernyataan suatu kejadian atau aktivitas dengan diiringi oleh keterangan waktu.</p><p></p><p>Kejadian atau aktivitas tersebut dapat terjadi pada masa lampau (the past), sekarang (the present) dan waktu mendatang (the future). Berdasarkan perbedaan tersebut, maka kemudian muncullah 16 jenis tenses dalam bahasa Inggris yang memiliki perbedaan fungsi berdasarkan keterangan waktunya.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Apabila seseorang sedang menyatakan suatu kejadian di masa sekarang, maka ia bisa menggunakan tenses yang diambil dari the present. Begitu pula jika Anda ingin membuat sebuah dongeng, tentu saja harus digunakan susunan kalimat berdasarkan the past karena sudah terjadi pada zaman dahulu.</p><p></p><p>Fungsi Tenses dalam Bahasa Inggris Secara Umum</p><p>Di dalam bahasa Inggris terdapat 16 jenis tenses yang memiliki fungsi berbeda-beda dan penggunaannya disesuaikan dengan keterangan waktunya. Adapun kegunaan dari penyusunan kalimat menggunakan secara baik serta tepat adalah sebagai berikut:</p><p></p><p>1. Menyatakan Suatu Peristiwa Secara Jelas</p><p>Seperti yang sudah disebutkan bahwa salah satu kegunaan dari tenses adalah untuk menyatakan suatu kejadian atau peristiwa secara merinci dan jelas berdasarkan keterangan waktu tertentu di masa lampau, sekarang serta mendatang. Semuanya berbeda sehingga perlu disesuaikan ketika menggunakannya.</p><p></p><p>Dalam menyatakan kejadian atau peristiwa, waktu menjadi salah satu faktor penentu dari susunan kalimat yang akan dibuat. Misalnya, pertayaan masa kini dan dongeng. Dua hal tersebut menunjukkan perbedaan perihal waktu sehingga ketika disampaikan kepada orang lain, maka tenses-nya juga beda.</p><p></p><p>2. Mengetahui Kapan Suatu Kejadian Berlangsung</p><p>Pada dasarnya terdapat 3 bentuk satuan waktu yang terdapat dalam tenses, yaitu past, present, dan future. Ketiganya memiliki fungsi dan penggunaan berbeda, seperti contoh kalimat “I am reading a book” dengan “I read a book”. Keduanya memiliki perbedaan jelas terkait arti maupun keterangan waktunya.</p><p></p><p>Oleh sebab itu, penggunaan tenses yang tepat dengan memperhatikan kaidah penyusunan kalimat secara benar dapat memberikan petunjuk berupa waktu. Sehingga pendengar atau lawan bicara ataupun Anda sendiri dapat mengetahui kapan peristiwa tersebut berlangsung.</p><p></p><p>3. Melancarkan Komunikasi Terhadap Lawan Bicara</p><p>Seperti yang sudah dijelaskan sebelumnya bahwa penggunaan tenses bisa menjelaskan pernyataan dari lawan bicara atau bahkan perkataan Anda sendiri sehingga komunikasi antara kedua belah pihak tetap berjalan secara lancar karena mengetahui keterangan waktunya.</p><p></p><p>Berbeda apabila tenses tidak diikut sertakan dalam percakapan, maka lawan bicara tidak akan mengetahui kapan peristiwa yang sedang dibicarakan tersebut terjadi. Hal ini menjadi penting apabila Anda sedang menyampaikan dongeng atau cerita lampau kepada orang lain.</p><p></p><p>4. Mendukung Tulisan yang Bersifat Formal</p><p>Berbagai instansi seperti akademik atau pemerintah memiliki standart tertentu perihal kepenulisan baik berupa surat atau edaran untuk disampaikan kepada para tokoh di dalamnya. Biasanya tulisan-tulisan tersebut harus ditulis dalam bentuk formal dan tentu saja menggunakan materi  bahasa Inggris yang baik dan benar.</p><p></p><p>Hal ini sangat perlu diperhatikan, terlebih jika Anda hendak menuliskan sebuah jurnal ilmiah dari hasil penelitian. Penulisan yang kurang tepat dan tidak disertai penggunaan tenses secara benar, dapat mengakibatkan adanya kerancuan dalam tulisan tersebut. Oleh sebab itu, penting sekali mempelajarinya.</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><p>Ada 5 subpoin menjadi fokus dalam artikel ini, yaitu:</p><p></p><p>1.Contoh Paragraf tentang Diri Sendiri</p><p>2.Contoh Paragraf tentang Orang Lain</p><p>3.Contoh Cerita tentang Keluarga</p><p>4.Contoh Paragraf tentang Tempat Terbaik untuk Liburan</p><p>5.Contoh Cerita tentang Pengalaman Liburan</p><br />

                        The Mice Who Travelled<br /><br />A Mouse, tired of living in constant fear, said to her neighbour, “I read about a place called Indies where Mice are safer. The people there believe that the soul of a Mouse has been in the body of a great person. After the Mouse dies, it will re-enter the body of another great person. That’s why Mice are treated affectionately there. Even hospitals are built for them. Let us go to this country and live happily.”<br />The neighbour replied, “Don’t Cats enter these hospitals? If they do, then the Mice would be dying, quickly and in great numbers.”<br />“Fear not,” said the first Mouse. “The Cats have their houses and hospitals far away from ours.”<br />The Mice then crept into a ship, which was set to sail. After a long journey, they reached Indies.<br />There, the Mice entered a house, expecting a warm welcome. However, the Indian Mice fought with the newly arrived Mice. Instead of being eaten up by Cats, they were killed by their own kind. <br />

                        It was a dark and stormy night. <br /><br />I was alone at home and about to go to bed, when I saw a scary shadow figure at my window. <br /><br />"Who’s there" I shouted. <br /><br />Suddenly there was a flash of lightning followed by thundershower. <br /><br />I saw a lion’s face followed by a scary thunderous roar at the window. It looked like the lion from the local circus that had been announced missing on the television news channel. I felt very scared. I ran to my bed and pulled my blanket over my head. I started to shout for my parents but there was no reply. Then I remembered they were at a late night party. <br /><br />I peeped out of my blanket but it was too dark to see anything. Then I heard footsteps. <br /><br />They were getting louder and louder. Soon the footsteps died off. <br /><br />The grand father clock struck 12. I went back to bed and tried to sleep, but couldn’t. I felt too frightened. I sat up my mind full of scary thoughts. After some time passed, finally I fell asleep. <br /><br />I woke up only after eight in the morning and switched on the TV news. I was excited to see the lion was already trapped in the wee hours of the morning by the ring master of the circus. I felt very much relieved after the news. <br /><br />Later I narrated the whole incident to my parents. <br /><br />They were dumb shocked and decided in future not to leave me alone at home during night.<br /><br />

                        Then one night, while the tavern was full of 
drinkers, a nasty character named O’Hare wandered into the bar. Women 
and children were not safe in his presence, but especially not women. <br />After
 O’Hare had consumed far too much alcohol, he suddenly announced to the 
bar that he’d seen a pretty young thing in the alley out back of the 
tavern. The bartender froze in the middle of polishing a glass, and the 
men around the bar exchanged covert glances. No one said a word, but 
everyone was thinking about the ghost of the vengeful young girl.  Everyone
 in the bar looked down at their glasses as he stumbled to his feet. No 
one made a move to stop him, and there was a quiet air of “he deserves 
what’s coming to him” about the bar as O’Hare left the building. It’s 
just too bad that there isn’t really a ghost, thought the bartender, 
setting down the shining glass and picking up another one to polish. 
O’Hare sorely needed a lesson in human kindness and respect for others. <br />At
 that moment, a horrible scream came from the alley. Everyone in the 
tavern looked up in shock and fear. Had there really been a ghost out 
there? Or was O’Hare up to his old tricks and even now accosting one of 
their womenfolk? <br />The men leapt to 
their feet and raced to the back door of the tavern. Pouring out into 
the street, they were met by an unnatural cold, and their eyes were 
dazzled by a blaze of light. <br />The 
bartender thrust his way to the front of the crowd and saw the body of 
O’Hare lying in a pool of bright white light. His throat had been torn 
to pieces, and blood was spilling out in gushes. Above him hovered the 
semitransparent figure of a young girl, her eyes gleaming with red fire,
 her mouth covered with blood. She glared down at O’Hare and then turned
 to look at the crowd. The specter licked the blood from her lips 
thoughtfully, her eyes on the bartender’s neck. Then she vanished, 
taking the light with her.  At their feet, O’Hare gasped out his last breath and died. <br />The
 local authorities were summoned to deal with the body of O’Hare. Though
 skeptical at first, they were finally convinced, since there had been 
so many eyewitnesses who had seen the ghost hovering over the dying man.
 <br />The bartender resigned his 
position the next morning and took a job across town, the memory of the 
ghost’s hungry stare at his neck prompting him to look elsewhere for 
employment. <br /><br />

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />
