Text 2 Way Kambas National Park Way Kambas National Park is a national park for elephant sanctuary located in Lampung precisely in the Labuhan Ratu sub district, East Lampung, Indonesia. Way Kambas National Park, established in 1985, is the first school for elephant in Indonesia. In the beginning of its establishment, Way Kambas National Park was named the Elephant Training Center / Pusat Latihan Gajah (PLG), but the last few years this name was changed into Elephant Conservation Center / Pusat Konservasi Gajah (PKG), which is expected to become a center for elephant conservation in taming, training, breeding and conserving elephants. Until now, this PKG has trained for about 300 elephants which have been deployed to all over the country.

The sun was still red and large: the sky above cloudless, and light blue glaze poured over
baking clay: but close over the ground a dirty grey haze hovered. As they followed the lane
towards the sea they came to a place where, yesterday, a fair-sized spring had bubbled up
by the roadside. Now it was dry. But even as they passed 
some water splashed out, and
then it was dry again, although gurgling inwardly to itself. But the group of children were
hot, far too hot to speak to one another: they sat on their ponies as loosely as possible,
longing for the sea.
The morning advanced. The heated air grew quite easily hotter, as if from some enormous
furnace from which it could draw at will. Bullocks only shifted their stinging feet when they
could bear the soil no longer: even the insects were too lethargic to pipe, the basking lizards
hid themselves and panted. It was so still you could have heard the least buzz a mile off.
Not a naked fish would willingly move his tail. The ponies advanced because they must. The
children ceased even to think.

When you chew your food, digestion begins. The food is pushed by the tongue to the trapoloor at the back of the throat called the oesophagus. it then moves to the stomach where digestive juice make it smaller n the small intestine. The goodness is â€˜soaked upâ€™. Finally water is taken out in the large intestine.

Makanan didorong oleh lidah menuju (pintu jebakan) di belakang mulut yang disebut esofagus.<br /><br />Itu kemudian bergerak ke perut dimana cairan pencernaan membuatnya lebih kecil.

The sun was still red and large: the sky above cloudless, and light blue glaze poured over
baking clay: but close over the ground a dirty grey haze hovered. As they followed the lane
towards the sea they came to a place where, yesterday, a fair-sized spring had bubbled up
by the roadside. Now it was dry. But even as they passed 
some water splashed out, and
then it was dry again, although gurgling inwardly to itself. But the group of children were
hot, far too hot to speak to one another: they sat on their ponies as loosely as possible,
longing for the sea.
The morning advanced. The heated air grew quite easily hotter, as if from some enormous
furnace from which it could draw at will. Bullocks only shifted their stinging feet when they
could bear the soil no longer: even the insects were too lethargic to pipe, the basking lizards
hid themselves and panted. It was so still you could have heard the least buzz a mile off.
Not a naked fish would willingly move his tail. The ponies advanced because they must. The
children ceased even to think.

How is Food Digested?
The food we eaten is broken down and used by our bodies. This breaking down of food is called digestion.
You may have heard your stomach gurgling after you have eaten. The stomach, teeth, tongue and intestines all help to digests food.
When you chew your food, digestion begins. The food is pushed by the tongue to the trapoloor at the back of the throat called the oesophagus. it then moves to the stomach where digestive juice make it smaller n the small intestine. The goodness is â€˜soaked upâ€™. Finally water is taken out in the large intestine.
The goodness that is left can now be carried around the body by the blood to be used for energy, repair and growth.</h2><br />
