                                            Mouse Deer and CrocodileOne day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”“Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.***tollong di artikan??</a>

But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.
In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”
“Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.***

                                            Long time ago time there were a smart mouse deer. He lived near a river. The mouse deer used to go to the river to drink.
One day, the mouse deer was thirsty. He wanted to drink in the river but he knew that crocodiles were staying and waiting underwater to eat him. He thought hard and got bright idea. He said out loudly. “I will put in my leg and find out whether the water is warm or not” Of course the mouse deer did not do what he said. He did not put his leg but the mouse deer took a wood stick and put one end into the water. Blurrr…! Surely a crocodile grabbed the wood stick and pulled it underwater. Seeing that, the mouse deer laughed and said “Stupid crocodile! Can’t you see the difference between a wood stick and a leg?” Then the mouse deer ran to another side of the river and drink some water.
On the following day, the mouse deer was hungry. He wanted to eat some grass on the side of the river so he had to to cross the dangerous river which was full of crocodiles. Again he thought hard and found another smart idea and said loudly “Crocodiles come up!” then some crocodiles rose from the water. They looked happy and saw their sharp teeth and said “Hello, Mouse Deer. Do you come to be my lunch? We are hungry” The mouse deer just smiled and replied. “Sorry, Crocodiles, not today, I come to you to bring an invitation from the king. You are invited to the party. The king ordered me to count all crocodiles in this river so he knew how to prepare enough meal for you.”All the crocodiles felt happy and said “Really…? Tell us what to do,” said a crocodile. “You have to line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said the mouse deer. Not long after that the crocodile got all his friends and family. He ordered to lined up across the river.
The mouse deer then jumped on the Crocodile’s back. “One,” the mouse deer counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And he jumped again on the next crocodile, “Three.” he kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “Just enough,” said the mouse deer. “I have counted all of you” He laughed and ran to the field of grass.

Mouse Deer and Crocodile
One day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.
In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea.

Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.</a>

But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”“Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.1. carilah irregular Verb dan regular Verb masing masing 20​</h2><br />

                            15. Long time ago time there were a smart mouse deer. He lived near a river. The mouse deer used to go to the river to drink.
One day, the mouse deer was thirsty. He wanted to drink in the river but he knew that crocodiles were staying and waiting underwater to eat him. He thought hard and got bright idea. He said out loudly. “I will put in my leg and find out whether the water is warm or not” Of course the mouse deer did not do what he said. He did not put his leg but the mouse deer took a wood stick and put one end into the water. Blurrr…! Surely a crocodile grabbed the wood stick and pulled it underwater. Seeing that, the mouse deer laughed and said “Stupid crocodile! Can’t you see the difference between a wood stick and a leg?” Then the mouse deer ran to another side of the river and drink some water.
On the following day, the mouse deer was hungry. He wanted to eat some grass on the side of the river so he had to to cross the dangerous river which was full of crocodiles. Again he thought hard and found another smart idea and said loudly “Crocodiles come up!” then some crocodiles rose from the water. They looked happy and saw their sharp teeth and said “Hello, Mouse Deer. Do you come to be my lunch? We are hungry” The mouse deer just smiled and replied. “Sorry, Crocodiles, not today, I come to you to bring an invitation from the king. You are invited to the party. The king ordered me to count all crocodiles in this river so he knew how to prepare enough meal for you.”All the crocodiles felt happy and said “Really…? Tell us what to do,” said a crocodile. “You have to line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said the mouse deer. Not long after that the crocodile got all his friends and family. He ordered to lined up across the river.
The mouse deer then jumped on the Crocodile’s back. “One,” the mouse deer counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And he jumped again on the next crocodile, “Three.” he kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “Just enough,” said the mouse deer. “I have counted all of you” He laughed and ran to the field of grass.

Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else. In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.” “Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.</h2><br />
                        Suatu hari, Mouse Deer turun ke sungai untuk minum. Tapi dia tahu buaya mungkin menunggu di bawah air untuk memakannya, jadi dia berkata dengan suara keras. "Saya ingin tahu apakah airnya hangat. Saya akan menaruh di kaki saya dan mencari tahu. "Tentu saja Kancil tidak memasukkan kakinya. Dia mengambil sebatang tongkat dan memasukkannya ke air. Chomp ...! Crocodile meraih tongkat dan menariknya ke bawah air. Rusa Kuda tertawa. "Ha ... ha ... ha ... Bodoh buas! Tidak bisakah Anda membedakan antara tongkat dan kaki? "Kemudian Rusa Kiri lari untuk minum di tempat lain. Keesokan harinya, Mouse Deer ingin menyeberangi sungai. Dia ingin makan buah di seberang sungai. Dia melihat sebuah floating log di sungai. Dia tahu Buaya itu seperti log saat dia melayang. Kancang Rusa tidak mau dimakan Buaya saat melintasi sungai. Dia punya ide. Dia berteriak keras, "Buaya!" Buaya bangkit dari air, "Halo, Kancil. Apakah Anda datang untuk menjadi makan siang saya? "Mouse Deer tersenyum. "Maaf, tidak hari ini, Buaya. Saya mendapat perintah dari sang Raja. Dia ingin mengundang semua buaya di sungai ini ke sebuah pesta. Dia ingin saya menghitung semua buaya sehingga dia bisa menyiapkan makanan yang cukup untuk Anda. "" Benarkah ...? Beritahu kami apa yang harus dilakukan, "kata Buaya. "Anda harus berbaris dari sisi sungai ini ke sisi lain," kata Kancil. Buaya kemudian mendapatkan semua teman dan keluarganya. Mereka berbaris menyeberangi sungai. Rusa Kiri kemudian melompat ke punggung Buaya. "Satu," dia menghitung. Dia melompat ke buaya berikutnya, "Dua." Dan buaya berikutnya, "Tiga." Rusa Kiri terus melompat sampai dia tiba di sisi lain sungai. "Berapa banyak yang ada?" Tanya Buaya. "Cukup," kata Kancil. Dia tertawa saat berlari ke hutan.<br />

Mouse Deer and Crocodile
One day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.
In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea.

                        1. We can learn from Mouse Deer that we have to think brilliantly before we do anything as in case of being careful. Also we can learn from Mouse Deer that as a smart person, you can trick the people with poor knowledge.<br /><br />2. We can learn from Crocodile that as a person we should be more focused on whatever that we are trying or about to do. To use the brain to think, and not to let your desire control your brain.<br /><br />3. It depends on the logic. If you know that you will be in danger if you don't cheat, then you should cheat. But, if you know that you will not be in danger if you don't cheat, you are supposed not to cheat at all.<br /><br />4. I would say thanks to the Crocodile for being silly and easily to be tricked and cheated.<br /><br />5. I would becareful and think my plan more seriously, just in case not to get cheated ever again.<br /><br />- Semoga dapat membantu. -<br /><br />
