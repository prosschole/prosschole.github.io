Mantu's Little Elephant
Little Mantu lived in a village deep in the jungle where elephants helped the men with their work. These elephants were so big and strong. They could lift up the heaviest logs with their trunks and toss them high in their in the air.
Now, Mantu had an elephant of his very own. His name was Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that some day he would become the biggest, strongest and bravest elephant in the jungle. The orther elephants heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises with their trunks. We’re so big and tall, but you’re so small. You’re nothing at all,’ said one big elephants.
Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a mischievous glint in his eye. You’re so tall and can see far away. We can see what is happening down here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the first to see anything slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After hearing the word snakes, the elephant screeched and off they go thundering in fight.“Did I say there were snakes?’ giggle Mantu . “ No, I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon his little friend’s back and went home to village to tell everyone about the foolish elephants.</a>

                                            harlie Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in London. His parents, Charles and Hannah, were music hall entertainers. His father deserted the family when Charlie was three and a half and his brother, Charlie would have become just one more child lost in poverty. Sydney, was nearly eight. All of Hannah's hopes were gone, but she was indomitable. Without her,sad people remember when they think of pin had put in his first proper appearance. old was to take the character to its heart and shabby a strange mixture of a child and g sad mischievous brave, and always a wow Charlie had found a character with que on earth could identify. His sadness Ape of comedy crossed every boundary. Being we were silent in these days), everyone understand biO as the tramp, was the eternal loser who has won in the end. He bridged the gap between sh and the poor the successful and the losers. ood as the little man who triumphed in the face of all difficulties. Charlie gave some dignity to the sonate giving them a chance to laugh at themselves, knowing that they could always win in the was this quality that gave the tramp universal popularity. He broke down all social barriers.By now Charlie had become famous and was producing his own films. One of the most famous in which the little tramp appears is The Kid. He had found the perfect actor for the role in the our-year-old Jackie Cogan, Charlie coaxed a wonderful performance hom Jackie The tale of the tramp and the kid touched everyone's heart and the film was a great success. It was shown in 50 countries. The Kid uce a social concern that deeply upset Chaplin, the treatment of abandonedChade was now the greatest and best-loved comedian in the world. He wash and famous beyond his wildest dreams, but his personal life was gged with troubles. His mother's death in 1928 was a big blow. Hannah a teem very, but she and Charlie had been laughing the day before she dest. Watching her suffering had been almost too much for him. He stood by her bed and saw that death had taken away all her pain. He remembered the stings and stories and wept.Ather the Second World War, the fear of communism swept through America Charlie was accused of communist sympathies. His film 'Modern Tines was seen as proof, but it had only been Chaplin's reaction to five milion unemployed people during the Great Depression. Chaplin was proud af bi triendships with men like the actor, Paul Robeson, and the playwright. Belt Brecht-both of whom were communists. When Charlie was on his way London for the premiere of his film, Limelight, he was forbidden re-entry to the United States. He settled in Switzerland. After a life of incredible and work, great triumphs and great sorrows and trials, Chaplin died in his nep on Christmas in 1977, surrounded by his family members.Gradually. Hannah was forced to sell all of their small treasures and even the things they needed. But often their shabby room seemed to be transformed into a glittering stage. Hannah sang and danced for her little audience of two and acted out plays for them. Somehow, she managed to keep Charlie and Sydney clean and warm, clothed, and fed. Hannah's attempts to keep them decently dressed were not so successful. She made clothes from her old theatrical costumes, and the boys were teased unmercifully as went about the streets in their strange, oddly-cut shirts. theyWhen money was short, Hannah showed the boys how to find amusement without it. She would sit at the window watching the passers-by and their character from the way they looked and behaved, spinning tales to Charlie and Sydney. Sometimes she would mime all that she saw in the street below, her hands and face describing it to the boys without one word being spoken. guessCharlie took in her skills just as she took in the sights and sounds of London, and he went on using them all through his life. There was simply not enough money coming in, and Hannah had to do something. In desperation she decided to go back to the stage, but all her worst fears came true; her voice failed completely.Poor Hannah's struggle to carry on singing was drowned in whistles. catcalls, and boos. She fled from the stage. The manager, listening to the uproar, was desperate. He saw little Charlie standing in the wings. He was better than nothing. He grabbed Charlie's hand and led him to the footlights.Charlie was five years old. The sight of this small child staring out at the audience brought a shout of laughter from them, but Charlie had been brought up among professionals and in the midst of performance. He planted his feet firmly and launched into a song. The audience was delighted and flung coins onto the stage, demanding another song. When Charlie calmly announced that he would go on once he had picked up all the money, there was another great shout of laughter. He was enjoying himself, and he went on dancing, singing, and doing impersonations until Hannah carried him off the stage.​</a>

                                            Before the creation of humanity, the greek gods won a great battle against a race of giants called the Titans. Most titans were destroyed or driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the titan Prometheus, whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus to fight with him on the side of gods. As thanks, zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight : to others, the ability to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods. But zeus degreed they were to remain humans and worship the inhabitants of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans  subserviest creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude creations with a greater purpose. So when zeus asked him to decide how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it into two parts to present to zeus. On one side, he concealed the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones under a thick layer of fat. When zeus chose the seemingly best portion for himself, he was outraged at Prometheus’s deception. Fuming, zeus forbade the use of fire on earth, whether to cook meat or any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled the mount Olympus to steal fire from the workship of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care of themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons and wage war. Prometheus’s flames acted as a catalyst for the rapid progression of civilization. When zeus looked down at this scene, he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained  to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture who whould tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back to be attacked again in the morning. One day, Neither Zeus nor Prometheus backed down in their hardheadedness for centuries. And who knows how many eons their struggle would have gone on if it hadn’t been for Zeus’ son, Heracles, who happened upon the chained Prometheus on his way to the Hesperides. Whether Heracles shot the eagle and freed Prometheus as a sign of gratitude for the latter advising him to send Atlas to fetch the golden apples and complete his labor – or it was the other way around, we may never know for sure. However, we do know that Zeus allowed this to happen and that afterward he and Prometheus buried the hatchet and finally made peace with each other.  Although Prometheus remained in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress, and power he brought to human hands. He’s also a reccuring figure in art and literature. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimatey, he reminds us of the potential of individual acts to ignite the world.

                                            The Tale of Tom ThumbOnce, there lived a countryman and his wife in a very comfortable cottage. Even though they had plenty to eat and drink, they were not at all happy because they had no children. They both wished very much for a baby. The wife wanted to take care of a nurse an infant.One day, when the wife sat weeping by herself, she said aloud, "If only had a little baby, should not care what it was like. I should be thankful for one if it were no bigger than my husband's thumb." A queen of the fairies heard her. As she knew the wife was kind to poor and likely to be a good mother, she granted her wish. When the husband came home, he felt very much pleased. He invited all his friends to come to his house. The countryman named the baby "Tom Thumb".As Tom grew older, he became very amusing and mischievous. Therefore, her mother was afraid to let him out of her sight. One day, while she was making a batter pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the bowl. Unfortunately, when her back was tuined, Tom fell into the bowl. The batter filled his mouth and prevented him from calling out. The mother gave the pudding to a tinker who was passing. The tinker was happy. When he brought the pudding, Tom cried out. The tinker was so ferrified that he let the pudding drop in the field. Tom ran home to his mother who had been looking everywhere for him. After the accident, Tom's mother never let him stay near her while she was cooking.Few days later, Tom and his mother went into the fields to milk the cows. Fearing he might be blown away by the wind, mother tied him to a thistle. While she was milking, a cow came and shallowed up Tom. Tom cried out for his mother from the cow's mouth. Seeing this, his mother rushed to him, caught him and carried him safely home.Some days after this, his father took him to the fields. However, Tom was lost in the field. Suddenly an eagle caught him up in his beak and carried him to the top of a great giant's castle and dropped him on the leads. The giant found and ate him, but Tom scratched the roof of the giant's mouth, and the giant threw him over into the sea. Then he was swallowed by a large fish. The fisherman brought the fish to King Arthur as a present. When the fish was opened, everyone was astonished at finding Tom inside. He was at once carried to the king who made him his court dwarf. The Queen was delighted with Tom and made him dance on her left hand.He danced so well that King Arthur gave him a ring, which he wore round his waist.Tom begged to the King to allow him to go home for a while. The king allowed him and gave money. After two days and two nights, Tom reached his father's house. His parents was happy and made a great celebration at his arrival. Tom spent three days at home and then set out for the court once more. Afterwards, Tom lived many years at court. He became one of the best beloved of King Arthur's knights.Answer the following questions based on the text above!1. Why did the countryman and his wife feel unhappy? l2. Why did the queen of the fairies decide to grant the wife's wish?3. Why was the baby named Tom Thumb?4. How was the characteristic of Tom Thumb?5. How did King Arthur meet Tom Thumb?​</a>

                                            Little Mantu lived in a village deep in the jungle where elephants helped the men with their work. These elephants were so big and strong. They could lift up the heaviest logs with their trunks and toss them high in their in the air. Now, Mantu had an elephant of his very own. His name was
Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that some day he would become the biggest, strongest
and bravest elephant in the jungle. The orther elephants heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises with their trunks. We’re so big and tall, but you’re so small. You’re nothing at all,’ said one big elephants. Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a mischievous glint in his eye. You’re so tall and can see far away. We can see what is happening down here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the first to see anything slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After hearing the word snakes, the elephant screeched and off they go thundering in fight.“Did I say there were snakes?’ giggle Mantu . “ No, I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon his little friend’s back and went home to village to tell everyone about the foolish elephants.</a>

                                            Once upon a time, there lived a very cunning and mischievous fox. One day the fox befriended the stork and invited the stork to have a feast. The stork happily accepted the invitation. The fox said that he could not make a big feast as promised, and just offered some soup in a shallow bowl! The poor stork could not eat it with its long bil1, but the fox easily licked the soup from the plate. Then, the fox asked her, "How is the soup?" The hungry stork replied, "Oh it is good, but my stomach is upset!" She left the place and invited him to her house for dinner. The day arrived and the stork served soup for both of them, in a narrow jar with a long neck. She was able to have the soup very easily, but the fox obviously could not. The stork asked the fox about the soup and the fox felt very ashamed, "I...I'd better leave now. I have a tummy ache." Humiliated, he left the place running.
1 . When the fox asked the stork about the soup, she said ....
a. The soup tasted bad and she did not want to eat. 
b. She had a stomachache and wanted to eat more. 
c. She did not feel well and could not eat anymore. 
d. The soup was so good and she wanted more. 
e. She could not eat with the shallow bowl</a>

They began to laugh and made rude noises with their trunks. We’re so big and tall, but you’re so small. You’re nothing at all,’ said one big elephants.
Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a mischievous glint in his eye. You’re so tall and can see far away. We can see what is happening down here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the first to see anything slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After hearing the word snakes, the elephant screeched and off they go thundering in fight.“Did I say there were snakes?’ giggle Mantu . “ No, I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon his little friend’s back and went home to village to tell everyone about the foolish elephants.</h2><br />

He broke down all social barriers.By now Charlie had become famous and was producing his own films. One of the most famous in which the little tramp appears is The Kid.

His film 'Modern Tines was seen as proof, but it had only been Chaplin's reaction to five milion unemployed people during the Great Depression. Chaplin was proud af bi triendships with men like the actor, Paul Robeson, and the playwright. Belt Brecht-both of whom were communists. When Charlie was on his way London for the premiere of his film, Limelight, he was forbidden re-entry to the United States. He settled in Switzerland.

Hannah was forced to sell all of their small treasures and even the things they needed. But often their shabby room seemed to be transformed into a glittering stage. Hannah sang and danced for her little audience of two and acted out plays for them. Somehow, she managed to keep Charlie and Sydney clean and warm, clothed, and fed. Hannah's attempts to keep them decently dressed were not so successful. She made clothes from her old theatrical costumes, and the boys were teased unmercifully as went about the streets in their strange, oddly-cut shirts. theyWhen money was short, Hannah showed the boys how to find amusement without it. She would sit at the window watching the passers-by and their character from the way they looked and behaved, spinning tales to Charlie and Sydney. Sometimes she would mime all that she saw in the street below, her hands and face describing it to the boys without one word being spoken. guessCharlie took in her skills just as she took in the sights and sounds of London, and he went on using them all through his life. There was simply not enough money coming in, and Hannah had to do something. In desperation she decided to go back to the stage, but all her worst fears came true; her voice failed completely.Poor Hannah's struggle to carry on singing was drowned in whistles. catcalls, and boos. She fled from the stage. The manager, listening to the uproar, was desperate. He saw little Charlie standing in the wings. He was better than nothing. He grabbed Charlie's hand and led him to the footlights.Charlie was five years old. The sight of this small child staring out at the audience brought a shout of laughter from them, but Charlie had been brought up among professionals and in the midst of performance. He planted his feet firmly and launched into a song. The audience was delighted and flung coins onto the stage, demanding another song. When Charlie calmly announced that he would go on once he had picked up all the money, there was another great shout of laughter. He was enjoying himself, and he went on dancing, singing, and doing impersonations until Hannah carried him off the stage.​</h2><br />

                            12. Before the creation of humanity, the greek gods won a great battle against a race of giants called the Titans. Most titans were destroyed or driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the titan Prometheus, whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus to fight with him on the side of gods. As thanks, zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight : to others, the ability to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods. But zeus degreed they were to remain humans and worship the inhabitants of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans  subserviest creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude creations with a greater purpose. So when zeus asked him to decide how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it into two parts to present to zeus. On one side, he concealed the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones under a thick layer of fat. When zeus chose the seemingly best portion for himself, he was outraged at Prometheus’s deception. Fuming, zeus forbade the use of fire on earth, whether to cook meat or any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled the mount Olympus to steal fire from the workship of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care of themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons and wage war. Prometheus’s flames acted as a catalyst for the rapid progression of civilization. When zeus looked down at this scene, he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained  to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture who whould tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back to be attacked again in the morning. One day, Neither Zeus nor Prometheus backed down in their hardheadedness for centuries. And who knows how many eons their struggle would have gone on if it hadn’t been for Zeus’ son, Heracles, who happened upon the chained Prometheus on his way to the Hesperides. Whether Heracles shot the eagle and freed Prometheus as a sign of gratitude for the latter advising him to send Atlas to fetch the golden apples and complete his labor – or it was the other way around, we may never know for sure. However, we do know that Zeus allowed this to happen and that afterward he and Prometheus buried the hatchet and finally made peace with each other.  Although Prometheus remained in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress, and power he brought to human hands. He’s also a reccuring figure in art and literature. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimatey, he reminds us of the potential of individual acts to ignite the world.

Even though they had plenty to eat and drink, they were not at all happy because they had no children. They both wished very much for a baby. The wife wanted to take care of a nurse an infant.One day, when the wife sat weeping by herself, she said aloud, "If only had a little baby, should not care what it was like. I should be thankful for one if it were no bigger than my husband's thumb." A queen of the fairies heard her. As she knew the wife was kind to poor and likely to be a good mother, she granted her wish. When the husband came home, he felt very much pleased. He invited all his friends to come to his house. The countryman named the baby "Tom Thumb".As Tom grew older, he became very amusing and mischievous. Therefore, her mother was afraid to let him out of her sight. One day, while she was making a batter pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the bowl. Unfortunately, when her back was tuined, Tom fell into the bowl. The batter filled his mouth and prevented him from calling out. The mother gave the pudding to a tinker who was passing. The tinker was happy. When he brought the pudding, Tom cried out. The tinker was so ferrified that he let the pudding drop in the field. Tom ran home to his mother who had been looking everywhere for him. After the accident, Tom's mother never let him stay near her while she was cooking.Few days later, Tom and his mother went into the fields to milk the cows. Fearing he might be blown away by the wind, mother tied him to a thistle. While she was milking, a cow came and shallowed up Tom. Tom cried out for his mother from the cow's mouth. Seeing this, his mother rushed to him, caught him and carried him safely home.Some days after this, his father took him to the fields. However, Tom was lost in the field. Suddenly an eagle caught him up in his beak and carried him to the top of a great giant's castle and dropped him on the leads. The giant found and ate him, but Tom scratched the roof of the giant's mouth, and the giant threw him over into the sea. Then he was swallowed by a large fish. The fisherman brought the fish to King Arthur as a present. When the fish was opened, everyone was astonished at finding Tom inside. He was at once carried to the king who made him his court dwarf. The Queen was delighted with Tom and made him dance on her left hand.He danced so well that King Arthur gave him a ring, which he wore round his waist.Tom begged to the King to allow him to go home for a while. The king allowed him and gave money. After two days and two nights, Tom reached his father's house. His parents was happy and made a great celebration at his arrival. Tom spent three days at home and then set out for the court once more. Afterwards, Tom lived many years at court.

                            16. Little Mantu lived in a village deep in the jungle where elephants helped the men with their work. These elephants were so big and strong. They could lift up the heaviest logs with their trunks and toss them high in their in the air. Now, Mantu had an elephant of his very own. His name was
Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that some day he would become the biggest, strongest
and bravest elephant in the jungle. The orther elephants heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises with their trunks. We’re so big and tall, but you’re so small. You’re nothing at all,’ said one big elephants. Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a mischievous glint in his eye. You’re so tall and can see far away. We can see what is happening down here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the first to see anything slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After hearing the word snakes, the elephant screeched and off they go thundering in fight.“Did I say there were snakes?’ giggle Mantu . “ No, I don’t think so,” smiled Opie. Mantu then climbed upon his little friend’s back and went home to village to tell everyone about the foolish elephants.</h2><br />
                        Mantu kecil hidup di sebuah desa di dalam hutan yang dalam dimana gajah membantu manusia bekerja. Gajah-gajah ini sangat besar dan kuat. Mereka mampu mengangkat batang kayu dengan melemparkannya begitu tinggi di udara. Sekarang, Mantu mempunyai gajahnya sendiri. Namanya Opie. Dia adalah seorang bayi dan Mantu sangat menyayanginya. Mantu membisikkan ke telinga Opie bahwa suatu hari dia akan menjadi yang gajah terbesar, terkuat dan pemberani di hutan. Gajah lain mendengarnya. Mereka tertawa dan membuat keributan dengan belalai mereka. Kami sangat besar dan tinggi, tapi kau sangat kecil. Kamu bukanlah apa-apa bagi semuanya, ujar salah satu gajah yang besar. Mantu melihat ke gajah besar dengan kilatan nakal di matanya. Kau sangat tinggi dan bisa melihat sangat jauh. Kami bisa melihat apa yang terjadi di hutan ini. Faktanya, kami akan menjadi yang pertama melihat ular merayap yang mungkin berbahaya. Setelah mendengar kata ular, gajah berciut dan mereka pergi bergemuruh. "Apakah aku berkata ada ular?" kekeh Mantu. "Tidak, ku pikir tidak begitu" senyum Opie. Mantu kemudian naik ke belakang teman kecilnya dan pulang ke desa untuk memberitahu semua orang tentang gajah bodoh.<br /><br />

                            19. Once upon a time, there lived a very cunning and mischievous fox. One day the fox befriended the stork and invited the stork to have a feast. The stork happily accepted the invitation. The fox said that he could not make a big feast as promised, and just offered some soup in a shallow bowl! The poor stork could not eat it with its long bil1, but the fox easily licked the soup from the plate. Then, the fox asked her, "How is the soup?" The hungry stork replied, "Oh it is good, but my stomach is upset!" She left the place and invited him to her house for dinner. The day arrived and the stork served soup for both of them, in a narrow jar with a long neck. She was able to have the soup very easily, but the fox obviously could not. The stork asked the fox about the soup and the fox felt very ashamed, "I...I'd better leave now. I have a tummy ache." Humiliated, he left the place running.
1 . When the fox asked the stork about the soup, she said ....
a. The soup tasted bad and she did not want to eat.
