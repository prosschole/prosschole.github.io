                                            Read the following text, and then answer the comprehension questions.                Meeting My Idol       Afgan has always been my favorite singer. I had always been thinking of how i would feel when i met him. Then i was suddenly hit by lightning when i found out Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a local auditorium. A day before the concert, there would be a meet-and-greet event at a local radio station. Feeling excited, i packed all my Afgan's CDs to get his signature at the event.      On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of Afganism (that's how Afgan's fans are called). They sat on the chairs prepared inside the radio station's lobby. Some stood in rows in the front yard of the radio station. A spot inside a lobby was prepared with a mini stage for Afgan's singing performance and a table for Afgan to sign Afganism's memorabilia. Finally, after about 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside the radio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had been waiting excitedly saying, "Good morning. How are you all?" The crowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of "Fine, thank you" and screams of Afgan's name.         Then, he started the event by singing his hit single "Dia dia dia". Afganism went even crazier; they sang along with him throughout the song. Of course, i did too. I couldn't take my eyes off this amazing singer who had released three albums. When he was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began to stand in the line. When i arrived at the table, i was speechless. It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person, which was awesome. He asked my name so that he could write it on the CD to say "To Mia, Love Afgan". He was also very friendly, so i didn't feel too nervous when i had a chance to take pictures with him. He was just an amazing person. That was one of the best days in my personal life history.Questions:1. How did the writer feel when she knew that Afgan was coming to town?2. Did the writer want to see the concert?3. When and where was the meet-and-greet event?4. What is Afganism?5. How did the fans wait for Afgan?6. What did Afgan do when he showed up in the lobby?7.

What is the writer's opinion about the meet-and-greet event?11. Why do you think people like Afgan?12. Is there something in the text that is not relevant to your life?13.

A spot inside a lobbywas prepared with a mini stage for Afgan's singing performanceand a table for Afgan to sign Afganism's memorabilia. Finally, afterabout 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside theradio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had beenwaiting excitedly saying, "Good morning. How are you all?” Thecrowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thankyou” and screams of Afgan's name.Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Diadia dia”. Afganism went even crazier; they sang along with himthroughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn't take my eyesoff this amazing singer who had released three albums. When hewas finished with the song, the host announced that it was timefor autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and beganto stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless.It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was reallycool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normalperson, which was awesome. He asked my name so that he couldwrite it on the CD to say “To Mia, Love Afgan”. He was also veryfriendly, so I didn't feel too nervous when I had a chance to takepictures with him. He was just an amazing person.

                                            Meeting My Idol          Afgan has always been my favorite singer. I had always been thinking of how I would feel when I met him. Then I was suddenly hit by lightning when I found out Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a local auditorium. A day before the concert, there would be a meetand-greet event at a local radio station. Feeling excited, I packed all my Afgan’s CDs to get his signature at the event.          On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of Afganism (that’s how Afgan’s fans are called). They sat on the chairs prepared inside the radio station’s lobby. Some stood in rows in the front yard of the radio station. A spot inside a lobby was prepared with a mini stage for Afgan’s singing performance and a table for Afgan to sign Afganism’s memorabilia. Finally, after about 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside the radio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had been waiting excitedly saying, “Good morning. How are you all?” The crowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thank you” and screams of Afgan’s name.          Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Dia dia dia”. Afganism went even crazier; they sang along with him throughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn’t take my eyes off this amazing singer who had released three albums.

Yes i love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, likethis one.It was monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when i heard the bell of the ice cream vendorfrom a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened mywallet, and i was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more thanenough for what i did for her.

Afgan has always been my favourite singer. I had always been thinking of how I would feel when I met him. Then I was suddenly hit by lightning when I found out Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a local auditorium. A day before the concert, there would be a meet-and-greet event at a local radio station. Feeling excited, I packed all my Afgan’s CDs to get his signature at the event.
On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of Afganism (that’s how Afgan’s fans are called). They sat on the chairs prepared inside the radio station’s lobby. Some stood in rows in the front yard of the radio station. A spot inside a lobby was prepared with a mini stage for Afgan’s singing performance and a table for Afgan to sign Afganism’s memorabilia. Finally, after about 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside the radio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had been waiting excitedly saying, “Good morning. How are you all?”. The crowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thank you” and screams of Afgan’s name.
Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Dia dia dia”. Afganisme went even crazier; they sang along with him throughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn’t take my eyes off this amazing singer who had released three albums. When he was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began to stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless. It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person, which was awesome. He asked my name so that he could write it on the CD to say “To Mia, Love Afgan”. He was also very friendly, so I didn’t feel too nervous when I had a chance to take pictures with him. He was just an amazing person. And it was the best day ever!

How are you all?” Thecrowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thankyou” and screams of Afgan's name.Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Diadia dia”. Afganism went even crazier; they sang along with himthroughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn't take my eyesoff this amazing singer who had released three albums. When hewas finished with the song, the host announced that it was timefor autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and beganto stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless.It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was reallycool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normalperson, which was awesome. He asked my name so that he couldwrite it on the CD to say “To Mia, Love Afgan”. He was also veryfriendly, so I didn't feel too nervous when I had a chance to takepictures with him. He was just an amazing person.

                            16. Meeting My Idol          Afgan has always been my favorite singer. I had always been thinking of how I would feel when I met him. Then I was suddenly hit by lightning when I found out Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a local auditorium. A day before the concert, there would be a meetand-greet event at a local radio station. Feeling excited, I packed all my Afgan’s CDs to get his signature at the event.          On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of Afganism (that’s how Afgan’s fans are called). They sat on the chairs prepared inside the radio station’s lobby. Some stood in rows in the front yard of the radio station.

<p>Berikut terjemahan teks agar kamu lebih paham:
</p><p>Afgan selalu menjadi penyanyi favorit saya. Saya selalu memikirkan bagaimana perasaan saya ketika bertemu dengannya. Kemudian saya tiba-tiba tersambar petir ketika saya tahu Afgan datang ke kota untuk konser di auditorium lokal. Sehari sebelum konser, akan ada acara temu sapa di stasiun radio lokal. Merasa bersemangat, saya mengemas semua CD Afgan saya untuk mendapatkan tanda tangannya di acara tersebut.
</p><p>
Pada Sabtu pagi yang cerah dan cerah, stasiun radio itu penuh dengan Afganisme (begitulah sebutan penggemar Afgan). Mereka duduk di kursi yang disiapkan di dalam lobi stasiun radio. Beberapa berdiri berderet di halaman depan stasiun radio. Sebuah tempat di dalam lobi disiapkan dengan panggung mini untuk pertunjukan nyanyian Afgan dan meja untuk Afgan untuk menandatangani memorabilia Afganisme. Akhirnya, setelah sekitar 40 atau 50 menit menunggu, Afgan muncul dari dalam stasiun radio. Dia tersenyum dan melambai kepada semua Afganisme yang telah menunggu dengan penuh semangat berkata, “Selamat pagi. Bagaimana kabarmu semua?". Kerumunan menjadi gila. Teriakan terdengar seperti campuran "Baik, terima kasih" dan teriakan nama Afgan.
</p><p>
Kemudian, ia memulai acara dengan menyanyikan single hit-nya "Dia dia dia". Afganisme menjadi semakin gila; mereka bernyanyi bersama dengannya sepanjang lagu. Tentu saja, saya juga melakukannya. Saya tidak bisa mengalihkan pandangan dari penyanyi luar biasa yang telah merilis tiga album ini. Ketika dia selesai dengan lagu itu, pembawa acara mengumumkan bahwa sudah waktunya untuk memotret memorabilia. Saya menyiapkan CD saya dan mulai berdiri di antrean. Ketika saya tiba di meja, saya terdiam. Tidak nyata hanya melihatnya sedekat itu. Saya pikir itu sangat keren melihatnya seperti itu karena dia benar-benar hanya merasa seperti orang normal, yang luar biasa. Dia meminta nama saya sehingga dia bisa menulisnya di CD untuk mengatakan "Untuk Mia, Love Afgan". Dia juga sangat ramah, jadi saya tidak merasa terlalu gugup ketika saya memiliki kesempatan untuk berfoto dengannya. Dia hanya orang yang luar biasa. Dan itu adalah hari terbaik yang pernah ada!

Afgan has always been my favourite singer. I had always been thinking of how I would feel when I met him. Then I was suddenly hit by lightning when I found out Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a local auditorium. A day before the concert, there would be a meet-and-greet event at a local radio station. Feeling excited, I packed all my Afgan’s CDs to get his signature at the event.
On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of Afganism (that’s how Afgan’s fans are called). They sat on the chairs prepared inside the radio station’s lobby. Some stood in rows in the front yard of the radio station. A spot inside a lobby was prepared with a mini stage for Afgan’s singing performance and a table for Afgan to sign Afganism’s memorabilia. Finally, after about 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside the radio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had been waiting excitedly saying, “Good morning. How are you all?”. The crowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thank you” and screams of Afgan’s name.
Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Dia dia dia”. Afganisme went even crazier; they sang along with him throughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn’t take my eyes off this amazing singer who had released three albums. When he was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began to stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless. It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person, which was awesome. He asked my name so that he could write it on the CD to say “To Mia, Love Afgan”. He was also very friendly, so I didn’t feel too nervous when I had a chance to take pictures with him. He was just an amazing person. And it was the best day ever!
