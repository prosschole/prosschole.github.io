                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatera lived a poor woman and his son, who called Malin Kundang. His Father eventually died, and his mother lived alone as a poverty-stricken old woman.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. One day, Malin Kundang decide going to overseas and promise to come back.</p><p></p><p>After several years had gone by, Malin Kudang finally decide to return to his village. He arrived wearing fine clothes and traveling on one of his ships. Someone arriving in such splendor was uncommon to the villagers, so many of them went down to the harbor to view the sight.</p><p></p><p>One of the villagers recognized Malin Kundang form a scar that he had received while playing as a child. Upon recognizing the mark, the villager went to tell Malin Kundang's mother that her son had returned. Excitedly, she went to the shore and recognized her son the minute her eyes fell on him.</p><p></p><p>When the older woman called him her son, he refused to believe that he head such an old woman as a mother. His disbelief was heightened when his wife questioned why he had not told her that he had an elderly, poor mother.</p><p></p><p>In an alternate translation, Malin Kundang was on the ship with just his crew. When his mother attempted to embrace him, he was too embarrassed by her ragged appearance to acknowledge her and instead, had one of them carry her away.</p><p></p><p>Distraught and finally realizing he son's wickedness, Malin Kundang's mother gave up on her son's acknowledging her and prayed to her god to punish her son for his behavior.</p><p></p><p>The day after his mother's prayer, Malin Kudang sailed out of the village. Shortly thereafter, the ships was met by a violent storm. Malin Kundang believed the storm was his god's and nature's ways of punishing him for his mistreatment of his mother.</p><p></p><p>He felt guilty about his behavior towards her, asked for forgiveness, and began to pray. However, his repentance was too late, for the ship was destroyed at sea. But, in some translations of the tale, Malin Kundang was turned into coral. In other, the ship, the crew, and he become rock formations that are still standing</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>BTW ada yang liat Jamal gak </p><br />

When Kala Haru drunk the water, Batara Surya (God of Sun) and Batara Chandra (God of Moon) recognized him. They reported him to Batara Guru. Batara Guru was furious knowing the Kala Haru’s camouflage. Then he cut Kala Haru’s head until separated from his body. His body was thrown down to the earth while his head remained alive and floated in the sky. It was because Kala Haru had drunk a little Tirta Amertasari.</p><p>Since that day, Kala Haru very grudge to Batara Surya and Batara Chandra. He kept chasing them by trying to eat the moon and the sun. However, they always escaped after being swallowed by Kala Haru because he did not have a body.

Dia menyamar menjadi dewa agar bisa mendapatkan Tirta Amertasari seperti dewa-dewa lainnya.</p><p>Kemudian Batara Guru meminta dewa-dewa itu meminum air yang diberikannya. Ketika Kala Haru meminum air itu, Batara Surya (Dewa matahari) dan Batara Candra (Dewa Bulan) mengetahui penyamaran itu. kemudian mereka melaporkan Kala Haru kepada Batar Guru. Batara Guru sangat marah. Lalu dia menebas kepala Kala Haru hingga terpisah dengan badannya. Badanya terlempar ke bumi sedangkan kepalanya tetap hidup dan mengambang di langit karena sempat meminum sedikit Tirta Amertasari.</p><p>Semenjak kajadian itu, Kala Haru sangat dendam terhadap Batara Surya dan Batar Candra. Dia terus mengejar mereka dengan berusaha memakan bulan dan matahari. Namun, mereka selalu lolos setelah ditelan Kala Haru karena dia tidak memiliki badan. Untuk menolong mereka, Batara Guru meminta kepada seluruh penduduk bumi untuk membuat banyak suara saat terjadi gerhana, sebagai pertanda munculnya Kala Haru. Suara itu akan membantu Batara Surya dan Batara Candra melarikan diri dari Kala Haru. Hingga saat ini orang-orang akan memukul lesung kayu/alat seperti penumbuk padi ketika mereka melihat gerhana.</p><p>Maaf kalau salah</p><br />

As adults mature, Sak Ayu is rarely invited by her parents to the bottom, so in reality the harvest is reduced, this is always considered by her parents, including local residents.
</p><p>
</p><p>The mother of three daughters named Mahesa Binti Madaru once dreamed that one of her children had Tuah Padi and the dream was told to Puyang Depati. Puyang Depati begged for guidance from the Almighty God about the truth of his wife's dream about her three daughters, and it turned out that the daughter who took the Padi was Sak Ayu, the youngest daughter of Puyang's drought.
</p><p>
</p><p>Since then the community believes that if they want to harvest successfully they should take Sak Ayu down to the bottom to lower the seeds and ask to be prayed so that the seeds planted will avoid disease and bear fruit. Eventually this story spread throughout the hamlet and until now people still believe in this rice dish.
</p><p>
</p><p>The entire Pang Sako rice field every year managed to harvest abundantly and many people thanked Sak Ayu. The community felt the benefits so that Pang Sako's rice fields were known by the community as the spirit of Sakayu's women's rice, and over time the area continued to grow and houses were built around the banks of the Musi river, starting from around the Simpit Canal to the upper reaches.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1745 AD the community began to build a lot of houses and open the rice fields, so the name Dusun Pangkalan Balai and Dusun Soak were renamed by Puyang Depati to Sak Ayu or Sekayu. After Puyang Depati was appointed as the leader of the clan, namely the Marga Mantri Melayu, the capital of the clan was named "Sakayu", gradually the community began to call the clan capital become Sekayu.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>The Legend Of Banyuwangi</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>The ruler of the kingdom of Blambangan, Raden Banterang, used to occupy the neighboring areas in order to expand his territory, including the Klungkung Kingdom of Bali. The outbreak of the Klungkung War destroyed such a small country. The king of Klungkung was killed on the battlefield, yet his daughter and son were able to escape and hide in the jungle.</p><p>One day, Raden Banterang and his commanders were inspecting his district while hunting. It was in the jungle that Raden Banterang met a beautiful lady named Ida Ayu Surati. She was then taken to Blambangan to be his wife. Raden Banterang and Ida Ayu Surati enjoyed a happy life in the palace.</p><p>When Raden Banterang was hunting one day, the lonely princess was surprised by the arrival of a dirty beggar asking for her pity. The princess was surprised to find that the beggar was her older brother, Agung Bagus Mantra. She promptly squatted and embraced her brother's legs. However, her great respect of her brother was not well accepted. Instead, she was tortured for she supposedly betrayed her noble family.</p><p>Agung Bagus Mantra asked his sister to kill Raden Banterang, but such a request was rejected. He was very angry with her and came up with a sly idea to slander Raden Banterang.</p><p>At first, Raden Banterang did not believe that his wife had been involved in a scandal with another man. Yet because of Agung's convincing words, he was finally influenced and therefore, his wife was dragged down to a small lake. Asking for compassion, Ida Ayu Surati tried to tell the truth and denied her husband’s accusation. Hearing his wife's explanation, the king became angrier and angrier. As a proof of her sacred love, she asked her husband to kill her. As a last request, she asked her husband to throw her dead body into the river. She said that if the water in the river smelled terrible, it meant that she had ever been sinful, but if it smelled fragrant it meant that she was innocent.<br />Raden Banterang who was unable to control his emotions, soon stabbed his keris (dagger) into his wife's chest. She died instantly. The dead body of Ida Ayu Surati was quickly thrown into the dirty river. Raden Banterang was shocked to see the river suddenly become clean and as clear as glass with a fragrant smell. Raden Banterang screamed crazily and regretted his deed. He walked unsteadily and fell into the river screaming, "Banyuwangi, Banyuwangi, Banyuwangi!”</p><p>Another legend of Banyuwangi was taken from the story of Sri Tanjung Sidopekso. Once upon a time, a local ruler, King Sulahkromo, had a patih, R.Sidopekso. The wife of the patih, Sri Tanjung, was so beautiful that the king desired her. In order to be able to seduce Sri Tanjung, the king ordered his patih on a mission that would take a long time to accomplish. During his absence, the king tried to court Sri Tanjung without success. When R. Sidopekso returned, he went first to his ruler. The king, angry that his scheme had not succeeded, told the patih that during his absence his wife had been unfaithful to him. Sidopekso went home and confronted his wife with her alleged adultery. Her denial did not convince him, and he announced that he was going to kill her. Sidopekso brought Sri Tanjung to the bank of the river. Before he stabbed her to death, she prophesied that her innocence would be proven. And indeed, after having stabbed his wife to death and having thrown the dead body into the dirty river, the river immediately became clean and began to spread a wonderful fragrance. Sidopekso said, “Banyu ... Wangi..... Banyuwangi”. This means "fragrant water ". BANYUWANGI was born from the proof of noble and sacred love.</p><br />

                                                                   <strong>Sangkuriang</strong><br />Once upon a time, a beautiful lady named Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a boy which she named Sangkuriang. When Sangkuriang was old enough to hunt, he took his mother’s dog Tumang (which according to this legend is an incarnation of a god and also Sangkuriang’s father) and ordered Tumang to chase after a boar. When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother. Dayang Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a deep scar on his head. Sangkuriang travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother. He asked for her hand in marriage and she agreed. Dayang Sumbi later realized that Sangkuriang was her son, as she recognized the scar that she had inflicted. She tried to tell him and break off the wedding, but he didn’t believe her and insisted to go on with the wedding. Dayang Sumbi then set an impossible condition that Sangkuriang has to fulfill in order to marry her: he should build her a big boat and a lake by damming Citarum river, all within one night, and it shall be finished by dawn. Sangkuriang agreed to the condition. He built a boat from a large tree, and with the help of spirits, he dammed the Citarum river with landslides. The water eventually rose and filled the plain, turning it into a lake. When dawn was near, he was almost ready. Dayang Sumbi realized this, so she prayed for divine intervention. As an answer to her prayers, the eastern horizon lit up. Deceived by the lights, cocks crowed and farmers rose for the new day, thinking that dawn has broken. Sangkuriang was also deceived. He thought his endeavor has failed. Angrily, he kicked the boat so that it toppled over. This boat became Tangkuban Parahu mountain (tangkuban means upside down, and parahu means boat). The pile of leftover woods became Mt. Burangrang, and the rest of the big tree became Mt. Bukit Tunggul. The lake became lake Bandung (which literally means ‘dam’). <br />Terjemahan:<br />                                           <strong>Sangkuriang</strong><br />Pada zaman dahulu, sebuah wanita cantik bernama Dayang Sambi melahirkan anak laki-laki yang di beri nama Sangkuriang , ketika dia sudah cukup umur untuk berburu , dia membawa Tumang yang merupakan *Guk Guk* milik ibunya (dan menurut legenda , *Guk Guk* ini merupakan inkarnasi dewa dan juga Ayah Sangkuriang) dan memerintahkan Tumang untuk mengejar seekor babi liar. Ketika Tumang tidak mengikuti perintahnya, Sangkuriang marah dan dia membunuh Tumang. Dia mengambil hati Tumang dan membawa hati Tumang ke ibunya. Dayang Sumbi mengambil hati tersebut, memasaknya dan memakannya , ketika dia tau bahwa hati tersebut adalah milik Tumang, Suaminya, dia marah. Lalu dia mengusir anaknya, dan memukulnya dengan dengan sendok sup, meninggalkan bekas luka. Lalu Sangkuriang menjelajahi dunia. Setelah itu , dia kembali ke desa nya sendiri tanpa ia sadari. Dia melihat seorang wanita cantik lalu jatuh cinta kepadanya. Dia tidak tahu bahwa wanita itu adalah ibunya sendiri. Dia lalu mengajak wanita tersebut menikah , dan dia setuju. Akan tetapi tidak lama setelah itu Dayang Sumbi mengetahui bahwa Sangkuriang adalah anaknya sendiri karena dia mengenali bekas luka yang disebabkan olehnya. Dia mencoba untuk memberitahunya untuk membatalkan pernikahan, tapi dia menolak. Lalu Dayang Sumbi memberi syarat yang tidak mungkin dilakukan agar Sangkuriang dapat menikahinya : Dia harus membuatkan sebuah perahu besar dan sebuah danau yang membendung sungai Citarum , hanya dalam 1 malam , dan harus diselesaikan sebelum pagi hari. Sangkuriang menyetujuinya, lalu dia membuat sebuah perahu dari sebuah Pohon Besar, dan dengan bantuan jin, dia membendung sungai Citarum dengan Longsoran tanah. Akhirnya air naik dan mengisi daratan yang longsor, dan menjadi sebuah danau. Ketika pagi tiba, dia sudah siap. Mengetahui hal ini , Dayang Sumbi memohon kepada Dewa agar usaha Sangkuriang gagal. Doa nya dikabulkan, lalu matahari terbit . Berpikir bahwa hari sudah pagi , ayam berkokok dan Petani bangun untuk bekerja. Sangkuriang merasa dibohongi, usaha nya gagal. Karena marah , dia  menendang perahu yang dia buat supaya perahunya terbalik. Perahu ini lalu dikenal dengan nama Gunung Tangkuban Parahu (Tangkuban artinya terbalik, dan Parahu artinya perahu).

                        long time ago there was a kingdom in West Java. The 
kingdom was ruled by a king called Prabu. He was a kind and wise king. 
Under Prabu’s leadership, the kingdom grew into a prosperous kingdom. 
There’s no hunger in the kingdom. Everybody in the kingdom loved their 
king. But, there’s one problem. The king and his queen hadn’t got any 
children. It made the couple very sad. That was why Prabu decided to go 
to the jungle. There, he meditated and prayed to God. Everyday he begged
 for a child. His dream finally came true. A few months later, the queen
 got pregnant. All people in the kingdom felt very happy. They sent many
 presents to the palace to express their happiness. Nine months later a 
baby girl was born. The baby grew as a beautiful teenager then. 

                    
    Prabu and his queen loved their 
daughter so much. They gave what ever she wanted. It made the princess 
grew into a spoiled girl. When her wish couldn’t be fulfilled, she would
 be very angry. She even said bad things often. Even though the princess
 behaved badly, her parents still loved her, and so did the people in 
the kingdom. 

                    
    Time passed and the princess 
grew more beautiful. In a few days, the princess would be seventeen 
years old. That’s why people of that kingdom brought many presents for 
her. They bring gold and beautiful jewelries. Prabu collected the 
presents. Then Prabu stored them in a special room. Some times he would 
take them to give to his people who needed it. Prabu only took a few 
gold and jewels. Then he brought them to a goldsmith. “Please make a 
necklace for my daughter,” said Prabu. “My pleasure, Your Majesty,” the 
goldsmith replied. The goldsmith worked with all his heart and his 
ability. He wanted to create the most beautiful necklace for the 
princess. 

                    
    The birthday came. People 
gathered in the palace field. Then Prabu and the queen appeared. They 
waved to their beloved people. Cheers were loud and louder when the 
princess appeared. Everybody admired her beauty. Prabu got up from his 
chair and took a small pillow. A beautiful necklace was on the pillow. 
Prabu took that necklace. “My beloved daughter, today I give this 
necklace to you. This necklace is a gift from people in this country. 
They love you so much. They presented it for you to express their 
happiness, because you have growing to a woman,” said Prabu. The 
princess accepted the necklace. She looked at the necklace in a glance. 
“I don’t want this necklace! It’s ugly!” shouted the princess as she 
threw the necklace away. The necklace hit the floor and was broken. The 
gold and jewels were spread out on the floor. 

                    
 No body dared to speak. They 
never thought that their beloved princess would do such a cruel thing. 
In their silence, people heard the queen crying. Every woman felt sad 
and began crying too. Then everybody was crying. Suddenly, from the 
middle of the field, a spring emerged. It quickly became a pool. The 
palace was getting flooded. Soon the place became a big lake. 

                    
    Nowadays the water on that lake 
is not as full as before. There is only a small lake now. People called 
the lake Telaga Warna (it means lake of colour). On a bright day, the 
lake is full of colour. These colors come from the reflections of 
forest, plants, flowers, and sky around the lake. But some people said 
that the colours are from the princess’ necklace, which spreads at the 
bottom of the lake.***<br />The Legend of the Pineapple FruitThere was a pretty little girl called Pina who was pampered by her mother as an only child. Everything that Pina asked for, Pina got. Everything that Pina scoffed at was taken away. No one in her village was ever so spoiled as Pina. No one was ever such a snobbish child. She was so lazy, and she had never stirred a finger to work in her life.Pina’s mother was perfectly happy that way, for Pina remained dependent on her as a spoiled child. But one day, Pina’s mother fell ill and there was no one to take care of Pina. She resolved that she would get well immediately for Pina’s sake – but she knew she would need help."Pina, Pina," she called weakly, from her cot. "Come here a moment. I have something to ask of you."Pina had never been asked to do anything in her life, and she was quite prepared to refuse, but she said anyway, "What is it, Mother?""Pina," said the doting mother, "I am too sick to make you anything to eat. I am too sick to eat anything solid. I need you to cook lugaw for me, Pina. It is very easy: just put some rice in a pot, pour some water in with it, add a pinch of sugar, and leave the mixture to boil for a while.""Oh, that’s too hard! I won’t do it," Pina said firmly."You have to, Pina!" her mother pleaded. "What will your poor Nanay eat?"But Pina was immovable. At length her mother resorted to shouting if only to catch her attention. Moping, Pina dragged her heavy feet down the stairs to gather the things she needed to make lugaw. She managed to find the rice, the water, the bowl, the sugar – but she could not find the ladle anywhere. How was she supposed to cook lugaw without a ladle?"Nanay, where is the ladle?" Pina shouted."It is beside the other kitchen utensils, Pina, you know where I keep them," her mother weakly shouted back.But the ladle was not anywhere near the other kitchen utensils, and Pina was too lazy to look for it elsewhere. "I can’t find the ladle, mother," she complained. "I guess I won’t be cooking without the ladle.""Oh, you lazy child," Pina’s mother wept. "You won’t even look! I hope you grow a thousand eyes so you’ll be able to find it!" After saying these words, Pina’s mother noticed that the house had fallen silent. Pina was no longer griping downstairs! That was a marvel. Perhaps she was already cooking. Pina’s mother would be happy if the child would cook her anything, even if it were burnt.But a long time had passed, and still the house was silent, and still Pina’s mother could not smell the cooking coals burning. She began to get worried. With all her meager strength she called out for Pina. Pina did not come, but the neighbors heard her pitiful cries, and they decided to drop by to see what was wrong. They took care of Pina’s mother in the child’s place."Where is Pina?" Pina’s mother asked at once. "Where is my child?""Oh, you know that girl," they assured her, "she must be in some friend’s house, having a good time. She hates responsibility. She may only be a little angry at you because you had asked her to work. It will pass, and she will come home."Pina’s mother rested easily with that thought, and she recovered quickly. But she was up and about and asking all around town for her precious little child, and still Pina had not returned.One sunny day, while Pina’s mother was cleaning their back yard, she saw a strange yellow fruit about as large as the head of a child that had sprung up from the ground. "How curious!" she thought, and bent to examine it. The strange, spiny yellow fruit, she saw, had a thousand black eyes."A thousand eyes...!" she gasped, remembering a mother’s curse carelessly let out. "My Pina!"But there was nothing to be done. Imagine a thousand black eyes and not one of them seeing, and not one of them being able to shed a tear. Pina’s mother, who still loved the child more than anything in the world, decided to honor her memory by taking the seeds of the strange yellow fruit and planting them. When after a while there was more of the fruit, Pina’s mother gave her harvest away to everyone she knew. Thus Pina, in another form, became generous to others.To this day the Filipinos call the yellow fruit pinya, after the pretty spoiled child.<br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><br /><p>Here's the story of "The Legend of Batu Menangis" in English.</p><br /><p>Once upon a time, in a village, there lived a mother and her daughter. Her daughter was very beautiful, but she had very bad behavior. She never helped her mother to work. The girl just spent her time to beautify herself and admire her beauty in the mirror every day, while her mother had to work hard to earn a living to support their life. Besides lazy, she was also very spoiled. She would cry if she wasn't given something that she asked. Of course, that situation made her mother sad but somehow she still loved her daughter.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, the girl asked her mother to buy new gown for her. Her mother rejected her request at first because she did not have enough money. But, her mother was forced to obey her request, so she fulfilled her daughter request in the end. Then her mother asked her daughter to accompany her to the market. “All right, but I do not want to walk beside you. You had to walk behind me, because I will be embarrassed if others see me “she said. Although her mother was sad, she continued to obey her request. So they went to the market to buy her daughter a new gown. The girl was walking in front while her mother was walking behind her and carrying a basket on their way to the market.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although they were a mother and a daughter, they looked very different. They did not look like they came from the same family. They even looked like a boss and a servant. How couldn’t be like that? Her daughter dressed up beautifully and wore a very nice gown. While her mother looked old and wore very simple dress.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the way to the market, There was a man greeting them. “Hey pretty girl, is she your mother?” asked the man.  “Of course she is not my mother. She is my maid, “said the girl. His mother felt so sad to hear her answer. But she was silent although her heart was crying. Along the street people kept asking the beautiful girl about her mother. But the girl always said that the old woman behind her was her maid.</p><p>
</p><p>In the end, the mother could not stand any longer to hear the answer that comes out of her daughter mouth. Then she prayed to god “Lord, please punish this ungrateful child,” she said. After saying this, the girl’s legs immediately turned to be stone. The change came slowly from her feet up to her head. Seeing his legs turned to be a stone, the girl screamed “oh no! What happened to my legs?” She shouted. Then she cried and realized that she had treated her mother badly. “Mom,! Forgive me. Please forgive me! “She cried in panic. The girl kept crying and begging for her mother's forgiveness but it was too late. Her whole body eventually became a stone. Her mother was sad to see what happened to her daughter but she could not do anything else. Although she had completely become a stone, people can still see her tears. That is the reason why the stone named Batu Menangis.</p><br /><p>Mudah-mudahan jawaban diatas dapat membantu menjawab pertanyaanmu.</p><br /><br /><p>Detil tambahan:</p><p>Kelas: SMA</p><p>Pelajaran: bahasa inggris</p><p>Kategori: narrative text</p><br />

                        Once upon a time there was a prosperous village in a far away island called Sumatra. In northern part of the island, lived a farmer whose name was Toba. He lived alone in a hut by a small forest. He worked on his farmland to grow rice and vegetables that he sells to local market. Once day he wanted to catch some fish so he went to a river and fished there. He was very surprised when he got a big fish. The fish was as big as human being. Soon he went home and put the fish in his kitchen. He planned to cook the fish for his dinner that night. When he got to his house that afternoon he took a bath. Then as he walked into his bedroom after taking a bath Toba was very shocked. Do you want to know what happened?<br />There stood in his living room a very beautiful girl. The girl greeted him nicely. For a moment Toba was speechless. When he could control his emotion he asked her.<br />‘Who are you? What’s your name? Why suddenly you are here in my house?’<br />‘Pardon me if I surprised you Mr. Toba, but you took me here. I was the fish that you caught in the river. Now that I become a human being again, I would like to thank you and I will be your servant to express my thankfulness’<br />‘Were you the fish?’<br />‘Yes, I was the fish. Look at your kitchen’.<br />Toba immediately rushed to his kitchen and the fish was nowhere to be seen. He saw some gold coins instead.<br />‘Whose coins are these? Why there are some coins here?’<br />‘Those coins are mine. As I changed into human being my scales changed into gold coins’<br />‘Ok you can live here and work for me. Your room is over there’<br />‘Thank you very much Mr. Toba’<br />Since that day the beautiful girl lived in Toba’s house. Since she was very beautiful Toba fell in love with her and not long after that they got married. The girl married to Toba on one condition that he would never tell anybody about her past. Toba agreed to the condition. Several months later Toba’s wife delivered to a baby boy. Their son was healthy. Soon he grew up into a handsome boy. Toba named him Samosir. Unfortunately Samosir was a lazy boy. He did not want to work at all. When his father worked hard in his rice field and farm, Samosir just slept. When he was awake he talked a lot and he ate a lot. Toba was very disappointed with his son’s nature. He hoped that one day Samosir would change into a diligent boy. Day in and day out but Samosir never changed.<br />Toba used to go to his farm and rice field early in the morning. Then at midday his wife would bring him food. They used to eat lunch at their farm. As he was a teenager Toba and his wife tried to change his behavior. They ordered Samosir to bring food for his father for lunch while her mother stayed at home to do household chores. But Samosir never did his duty well. He always woke up very late. He woke up after midday. Then one day his mother forced him to bring the food.<br />‘Sam, wake up. Go to the farm and bring the food for your father. He must be very tired and hungry now’.<br />But Mom, I am tired and hungry too’<br />‘What makes you tired? You just wake up. Go now. You father needs the food’<br />Toba reluctantly went to the farm. But he did not go to the farm immediately. He stopped somewhere in the street and ate the food. It was already late afternoon when he got to the farm. His father was disappointed. Then he was angry as he realized that his son had eaten his food. He said sarcastically.<br />‘O, you are stupid lazy boy. You are son of a fish!’<br />Samosir was hurt. He went home right away and as he got home he told his mother about his father’s words. Samosir’s mother was shocked. She was also deeply hurt.<br />‘O Toba. You break your promise so I cannot live with you here anymore. Now you have to accept to consequence of what you did. Samosir, now go to the hill, find the tallest tree and climb it’<br />‘Why mom? What will happen?’<br />‘Just do it, never ask any question. Good bye’<br />As soon as she finished saying that suddenly the weather changed. Sunny day suddenly turned into cloudy day. Not long after that the rain poured hea<br />
