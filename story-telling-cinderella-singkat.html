                            1. story telling cinderella singkat dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>CINDERELLA</strong><br /></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a girl 
called Cinderella. she was happy live with her father and mother. until 
her mother died dead and her father had married a widow with two 
daughters. Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two 
daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to 
work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a 
while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her 
Cinderella.</p>
<p>Cinderella used to spend long hours all 
alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really 
meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and
 that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old 
rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid 
and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always 
would be.</p>
<p>One day, beautiful new dresses arrived 
at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters 
were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could 
go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re 
staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the 
beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. 
Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured 
“Miaow.”</p>





<p>Suddenly something amazing happened. As 
Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy
 appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you 
would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in 
rags?” Cinderella replied.</p>
<p>The fairy smiled. With a flick of her 
magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she
 had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would
 never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” 
said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, 
bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”</p>
<p>Cinderella soon returned with the 
pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a 
flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and 
the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a 
coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly
 believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. 
But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. 
Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice
 again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these 
glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I 
understand!”</p>
<p>Cinderella had a wonderful time at the 
ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what 
the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the 
Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her 
slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! 
If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that 
would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was now madly in love 
with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and 
search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will 
never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper 
on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved 
her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, 
shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at 
her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The 
Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived 
happily ever.</p><p>Semoga membantu!!!<br /></p><br /><br />

                            2. Story telling Cinderella singkat (4 paragraf)​</h2><br />
                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Cinderella lives with her mother and two stepsisters</p><p> Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p><p> She lives with her two stepsisters and a stepmother.  They didn't like Cinderella at all.  Cinderella was always told to do many things.  Starting from cooking, washing, mopping, and all other household chores are done by Cinderella alone.</p><p> Because she continues to work, Cinderella can only be friends with rats hiding in her house.  The rats were afraid that the cat's pet stepmother would hunt them.</p><p> One day, a guard from the kingdom came to the village.  He announced that there would be a party to find a wife for the prince.  It made all the girls in the village feel good, including Cinderella.  However, the two stepsisters and stepmother did not like it when Cinderella joined the party.</p><p> When the night of the party arrived, the stepmother gave Cinderella a lot of work.  Of course, so that Cinderella didn't have time to come to the party.  However, Cinderella was determined, she would still come to the event.  All of his work was completed quickly.</p><p> “This is a royal event.  Are you going to wear your old clothes? "  sneered the stepmother.</p><p> Cinderella became sad.  What her stepmother said was true, she could not have come to the party with her old clothes on.  Finally, the two stepbrothers and stepmother left without Cinderella.  Cinderella could only cry sadly in the backyard.</p><p> Meanwhile, at the palace, a party is underway to find a future wife for the prince.  However, it seemed that none of the girls were able to attract the prince's attention.  Likewise with Cinderella's two stepsisters, they were unable to attract the prince.</p><p> The Prince's Party in the Palace</p><p> Cinderella was still crying behind the house. Suddenly ...</p><p> Clingg!  Olala, her tears turned into a fairy.</p><p> "Why are you sad, Cinderella?"  asked the fairy.</p><p> Cinderella explained everything.  Hearing Cinderella's explanation, the fairy became pity.  He also intends to help Cinderella.</p><p> "Take a pumpkin, and call your mouse friends," pleaded the fairy.</p><p> Without wasting time, Cinderella obeyed the fairy orders.  With her magic wand, the fairy turns the pumpkin into a very beautiful horse carriage.  As for the mice, they were turned into bodyguards.  Cinderella herself, was turned into a princess.  Really, Cinderella looks very beautiful.  She was wearing a very beautiful dress and glass slipper.</p><p> "Remember, Cinderella.  My magic only lasts until midnight.  So, before twelve o'clock at night you have to go home, "said the fairy when he let Cinderella go.</p><p> Cinderella nodded in understanding.  He immediately went to the prince's palace using his pump train.  Arriving at the palace, the prince saw Cinderella.</p><p> "What a beautiful girl," murmured the prince.</p><p> Prince walked closer to Cinderella.  Olala, he asked Cinderella to dance.  How happy Cinderella.  He also danced with the prince.</p><p> Imperceptibly, it was almost twelve in the evening.  It was twelve in the evening, the clock in the palace chimed loudly.  Cinderella immediately remembered the fairy message.  He also said goodbye to the prince.</p><p> Prince tries to prevent Cinderella.  But too late, Cinderella was already running fast to the pump train.  However, while running, Cinderella's glass slipper accidentally fell.  The prince picked up the glass slipper, and stared sadly at Cinderella's departure.</p><p> After the ball, the prince became gloomy.  He is sad because he can't find the girl he loves, who is none other than Cinderella.  Knowing the prince's sadness, the king made a contest.  Anyone whose foot size fits the glass slipper is the girl who is sought.</p><p> The prince, accompanied by his guards, came to the houses of residents who had girls.  But, of the many girls who try glass shoes, not one girl has the right foot size.  The prince almost gave up.</p><p> The prince entered the last house, namely Cinderella's house. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother and two siblings did not allow Cinderella to try on the glass slipper.  They gave Cinderella a lot of work behind the house.  That way, the prince didn't know that there was another girl in the house.</p><p> Cinderella's two stepsisters also tried the glass slipper, but it still didn't fit.</p><p> "Where else to look for that girl, Prince?"  asked the bodyguard.</p><p> "I don't know either.  Maybe we won't be able to find the girl, "replied the prince sadly.</p><p> Suddenly, there was a very melodious singing from behind Cinderella's house.  The prince was curious.  He looked for the origin of the voice.</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</strong><br />A shepherd-boy, who watched a group of sheep near a village, shocked out the villagers three or four times by screaming out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and when his neighbors were there to help him,he laughed at them for their pains.<br />However the Wolf, truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really in danger, cried in an agony of terror: “Pray, please come and help me; the Wolf is approaching to kill the sheep”; but no one paid any attention to his cries, nor rendered any help.

One day she was sitting there, all by herself, and it was very still. Suddenly, she heard a little tap, tap, tap, at the door.<br /><br />"Who is that?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and I want to come in," said a soft, sad, little voice.<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," the little Rosebud said. By and by she heard another little tap, tap, tap, on the window pane.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />The same soft little voice answered, "It's the Rain, and I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," said the little Rosebud.

At last, there came a little rustling, whispering sound, all round the window:rustle, whisper, whisper.<br /><br />"Who is there?" said the little Rosebud.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said a little, soft, cheery voice, 'and I want to come in! "<br /><br />"N -- no," said the little pink rose, "you can't come in." And she sat still again.<br /><br />Pretty soon, she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said the cheery little voice, "and I want to come in, I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, no," said the little pink rose, "you cannot come in."<br /><br />By and by, as she sat so still, she heard tap, tap, tap, and rustle, whisper, rustle, all up and down the window pane, and on the door, and at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and the Sun, the Rain and the Sun," said two little voices, together, "and we want to come in! We want to come in! We want to come in!"<br /><br />"Dear, dear," said the little Rosebud, "if there are two of you, I s'pose I shall have to let you in."<br /><br />So she opened the door a little wee crack, and they came in. And one took one of her little hands, and the other took her other little hand, and they ran, ran, ran with her, right up to the top of the ground. Then they said, --<br /><br />"Poke your head through!"<br /><br />So she poked her head through; and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden. It was springtime, and all the other flowers had their heads poked through; and she was the prettiest little pink rose in the whole garden!<br /><br /><br />

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />

She was in believe and un-believe that the man on the ship is his son. She said to God to make sure about it. “ God if he is not my son, forgive me that I have felt he is my son, but if he is my son, you are the Justest King”.<br />            In a short time, the sky became dark, the thunder rumbled. No light then after the last thundering sound. After everything in normal condition, there was a big stone of Malin Kundang and his ship.<br />

                        The Lonely LandyOne day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br />

He then followed the centipede until they reach a small pond not far from their house. Then the centipede suddenly disappeared. The farmer went home and found his wife still soundly asleep.
<br />In the morning, the wife told his husband about the dream she had last night. “I was walking through a vast field, and I came to a lake. I saw a giant hedgehog in the lake. It was glaring at me, so I ran away.” After he heard his wife’s dream, the farmer went back to the small pond. In the pond, he saw something very shiny. He came to the shiny object and took it. It was a golden hedgehog statue. It was very beautiful. Its eyes were made of diamond. The farmer then brought the statue home.
<br />At night, the farmer had a dream. A giant hedgehog came to him, “Please let me stay in your home. As return, I will give you everything you want. Just caress the statue’s head and say the prayer. There are two kinds of prayers, one is to start your wish and the second is to stop your wish. Now memorize the prayers.”
<br />In the next day, the farmer told his wife about his dream. They really wanted to prove it. The farmer slowly caressed the statue's head. He said the prayer and asked for rice. Suddenly, rice came out of the mouth of the statue. The rice kept on coming out from the statue's mouth. The farmer immediately said the prayer to stop it. The rice then stopped coming out from the statue.
<br />The farmer and his wife then asked for other things, jewelry and other stuff they needed. They became very rich. But they still like to help other people. A lot of poor came to them for help. Unfortunately, a thief found out about the secret of the golden hedgehog statue. Pretending to be a poor asking for help, he stole the statue from the farmer’s house.
<br />The thief blurred to the district area of Ngabang. There was a drought in the area. The thief wanted sympathy from the people, so he said to them that he would provide them with water. The thief then caressed the hedgehog statue and said the prayer. Water came out of the statue’s mouth. All the people were so happy. But the water kept on coming out. The thief didn’t know the prayer to stop the wish. People who saw the incident were really scared. They ran away to avoid the water as it was started to flood the area. The thief also wanted to run away, but he cannot move his legs. In his vision, there was a giant hedgehog holding both his legs. Water kept coming from the statue and slowly it became a river. The thief was drowned in the river. People then named the river as Hedgehog River or Sungai Landak.***

But then, Prambanan kingdom was attacked and occupied by the Pengging kingdom. Prambanan then was ruled by Bandung Bondowoso of Pengging kingdom. He was a mean king.

Bandung Bondowoso fell in love with her and wanted to marry her. “You’re very beautiful. Would you be my queen?” asked Bandung Bondowoso. Loro Jonggrang was shocked. She didn’t like Bandung Bondowoso because he was a mean person. She wanted to refuse, but she afraid that Bandung Bondowoso would be angry and endangered the people of Prambanan. Then, she came up with a plan. “If you want to marry me, you have to build a thousand temples for me in just one night,” said Loro Jonggrang. “What? That’s impossible!” said Bandung Bondowoso. But he did not give up. He consulted with his advisor. “Your Majesty can asked the genies to help built the temples,” said the advisor.<br />So, Bandung Bondowoso summoned his entire genies soldier and commanded them to help him built a thousand temples. The genies worked in unbelievable speed. Meanwhile, Loro Jonggrang heard from her servant that the building of a thousand temples was almost finished. She was so worried. But again, she came up with a great idea. She asked all of her servants to help her. “Please prepare a lot of straw and mortar. Please hurry up!” said Loro Jonggrang. “Burn the straw and make some noise pounding the mortar, quickly.” All those servants did what Loro Jonggrang ordered them; burning straw and pounding the mortar, making the genies think that the sun is going to rise.<br />“It’s already dawn. We have to go,” said the leader of the genies to Bandung Bondowoso. All the genies immediately stopped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they afraid of. They didn’t know that the light was from the fire that burning the straw, not from the sun.<br />Bandung Bondowoso can’t stop the genies from leaving. He was angry. He knew Loro Jonggrang had just tricked him. “You cannot fool me, Loro Jonggrang. I already have 999 temples. I just need one more temple. Now, I will make you the one-thousandth temple.” He pointed his finger to Loro Jonggrang and said some mantras. Magically, Loro Jonggrang’s body turned into stone. Until now, the temple is still standing in Prambanan area, Central Java. And the temple is called Loro Jonggrang temple.<br /><br />Ini doang cerita rakyat yang paling singkat yg lainnya minimal 5 paragraph<br />

                        The Rabbit and The Turtle

<br />

One day a
rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle
for being so slow. Much to the rabbit’s surprise, the turtle challenged him to
a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The
fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way
ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought. The rabbit got to the halfway
point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided
to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able
to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking
step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just
kept going.

<br />

However, the
rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the
turtle anywhere! He went at full-speed to the finish line but found the turtle
there waiting for him.

He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br />Maaf kalau salah :)<br />

                        Ir.Soekarno<br /><br />Actually he is not only a hero, but a great inspiration too. I choose him because I guess he is the great orator who was ever born in Indonesia. Many people were influenced by him until now. But not all people in the world know him, so I want to tell you a story about him.<br /><br />Born in Blitar, East Java, on Jun 10, 1901, He was named Kusno Sosrodihardjo but he was renamed Soekarno because he often got ill. There was a story when he was born. Soekarno was born in the morning , and there was a myth that the child who was born when the sun rises will be predicted to be a big figure on his time. Many people called him Son of the Sun. Stories about his childhood is known that he had a great attitude to communicate with other people.<br /><br />Growth as a talented boy, Soekarno continued his study to HBS in Surabaya. Then he went to Institute of Technology in Bandung (Bandung Institute of Technology) on Civil Department. He spent only 3 years to finish his study. He was not only a smart student but also active in Movement Party called PNI . He was arrested in 1929 by Dutch Colonial Authorities because of his activity in Indonesia Pro-Independence Movement. When he was released, he became a popular hero. He was arrested several times during the 1930’s and was put in jail when Japan occupied the archipelago in 1942.<br /><br />When Japan came to Indonesia, He was still active in Movement Party. On November 10, 1943 Soekarno became the leader of BPUPKI that was supported by Japan. Finally, on August 17, 1945 Indonesia declared the Independence day, and he became the first President of Indonesia.<br /><br />He passed away in 1970 and was buried in Blitar, East Java. Indonesian people were full of sadness. Although he had gone, his spirit is still alive and influences many people until now.<br /><br />Semoga membantu❤<br /><br /><p>My favourite national hero is Raden Adjeng Kartini. Because she was also a pioneer in the area of education for girls and women's rights for Indonesians. <br /><br />She was born into an aristocratic Javanese family when Java was part of the Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. She was born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition. <br /><br />Kartini's family allowed her to attend school until she was 12 years old. She learnt to speak Dutch, an unusual accomplishment for Javanese women at the time. <br /><br />Kartini continued to educate herself on her own. Because she could speak Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends. One of them, a girl by the name of Rosa Abendanon, became a close friend. Books, newspapers and European magazines fed Kartini's interest in European feminist thinking, and fostered the desire to improve the conditions of indigenous Indonesian women, who at that time had a very low social status.<br /><br />Kartini's concerns were not only in the area of the emancipation of women, but also other problems of her society. Kartini saw that the struggle for women to obtain their freedom, autonomy and legal equality was just part of a wider movement.<br /><br />Her husband understood Kartini's aims and allowed her to establish a school for women in the east porch of the Rembang Regency Office complex. Kartini's only son was born on 13 September 1904. A few days later on 17 September 1904, Kartini died at the age of 25. She was buried in Bulu Village, Rembang.<br /><br />R.A. Kartini argue that not only was she a feminist who elevated the status of women in Indonesia, she was also a nationalist figure, with new ideas, who struggled on behalf of her people and played a role in the national struggle for independence.</p><br />

Once upon a time in North

went home. At home Toba was very surprised because the fish could talk. “Please don’t eat me.” Said golden fish. “Who are you? How can you talk?” said Toba surprised. “I’m a golden fish, please don’t eat me.” Said golden
fish. “Mmm, all right.” Said Toba.

The next day, Toba went
farmer in the field. Toba farmer from morning until noon. He was very hungry
and tired, so he went home. At home, Toba was very surprised because there was
a beautiful girl who was cooking. “Who are you? Why are
you in my house?” said toba surprised. “I’m
sorry, I was a golden fish and now I human form, I’m here to give you some
food, as a sign of my gratitude.” Said the beautiful girl.

Time the past Toba and

years old, he was very lazy, stubborn, and mischievous. One day “Samosir, please deliver this food to your father, mother was

anxiety.

Toba felt really upset
with his son. And, suddenly he said something rude that was forbidden. “Your manner is like a little animal. It’s because your mother
is a fish. So you are like her. Go away from here!” Toba didn’t realize
that what he said was so rude. He was forbidden to tell about Samosir mother’s
origin.

Samosir sad and tell all
to his mother. “Calm down, Samosir. Don’t cry anymore.
Now, all you have to do is climbed the highest tree and stayed there. There
will be a huge flood and this village will be sink and disappear.” Said
mother.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Di hutan elang tinggal di sebuah pohon. Ia telah membangun sarang  untuk meletakkan telurnya. Ada elang akan menetas telurnya sepanjang hari.</p><p>Di bawah pohon yang sama hiduplah ayam. Ayam juga telah meletakkan telur selama periode yang sama ketika elang telah meletakkan telurnya.</p><p>Suatu hari, saat elang telah pergi untuk berburu, beruang memanjat pohon dan mengambil telur elang. Beruang telah selesai memakan tiga telur dan sisa satu kemudian ia menyelinap pergi telur yag ia bawa jatuh ke dalam sarang ayam. saat kembali, elang tidak bisa menemukan telurnya. Merasa sangat kecewa, dia memutuskan untuk meninggalkan tempat itu.</p><p>Ayam yang hidup di bawah pohon melihat telur elang di sisi telurnya. Dia merasa kasihan dengan telur elang, dan memutuskan untuk menetasinya . Setelah beberapa hari, ayam anak ayam menetas. begitu juga dengan telur elang.</p><p>Ayam pun memberi makan semua anak ayam termasuk anak elang seolah-olah anaknya sendiri, anak ayam pun mulai tumbuh.</p><p>Ayam muda akan mendengarkan suara ibu mereka dan mencoba untuk menirunya. anak elang pun mencobanya. Anak ayam pun bermain bersama dan membuat banyak kebisingan.</p><p>Dalam waktu singkat ayam ayam serta anak elang dibesarkan untuk ukuran penuh mereka. anak elang tidak pernah menyadari bahwa dia adalah sebuah elang dan bukan ayam. ia pun mempertimbangkan dirinya seperti ayam. Elang tidak pernah belajar untuk terbang seperti elang lain dan menghabiskan seluruh hidupnya seperti ayam.</p><br />
