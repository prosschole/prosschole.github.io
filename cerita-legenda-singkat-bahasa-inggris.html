Each day she tried to think a way to separate Sidapaksa from his wife.Not long afterwards, a son was born. The baby’s birth gave much happiness to the young mother. However, one day, while young mother was bathing, her evil mother–in-law threw the baby into the river. Knowing that her baby had disappeared, the young mother was very sad. She could neither eat nor sleep. She became very ill.Two years passed and Sidapaksa returned from his journey. He succeeded in doing his duty. Just as he was about to enter his house, her mother told him that his wife had thrown their baby into the river. Sidapaksa believed her mother’s story. He was too angry to use his common sense. He drew his keris and approached her wife who was lying weak on her bed.Sidapaksa took her wife to the edge of the river. Suddenly, his wife leaped up and threw herself into the river.“Oh my God! How will I know who killed my child?” moaned Sidupaksa.Then he looked down the water. Suddenly, two pure white flower buds appeared, one longer and taller than the other. A sweet fragrance came from them.“Father, my mother is innocent. Grandmother threw me into the river. Now I am happy because my beloved mother has come with me,” The smaller one spoke. Then, the two flowers vanished into the water. They left their fragrance behind.Since then, people call the city on its banks of the river Banyuwangi.Banyu means water and wangi means fragrant.<br /><br />Aku udh coba bikin sesingkat singkatnya<br />

                        long time ago there was a kingdom in West Java. The 
kingdom was ruled by a king called Prabu. He was a kind and wise king. 
Under Prabu’s leadership, the kingdom grew into a prosperous kingdom. 
There’s no hunger in the kingdom. Everybody in the kingdom loved their 
king. But, there’s one problem. The king and his queen hadn’t got any 
children. It made the couple very sad. That was why Prabu decided to go 
to the jungle. There, he meditated and prayed to God. Everyday he begged
 for a child. His dream finally came true. A few months later, the queen
 got pregnant. All people in the kingdom felt very happy. They sent many
 presents to the palace to express their happiness. Nine months later a 
baby girl was born. The baby grew as a beautiful teenager then. 

                    
    Prabu and his queen loved their 
daughter so much. They gave what ever she wanted. It made the princess 
grew into a spoiled girl. When her wish couldn’t be fulfilled, she would
 be very angry. She even said bad things often. Even though the princess
 behaved badly, her parents still loved her, and so did the people in 
the kingdom. 

                    
    Time passed and the princess 
grew more beautiful. In a few days, the princess would be seventeen 
years old. That’s why people of that kingdom brought many presents for 
her. They bring gold and beautiful jewelries. Prabu collected the 
presents. Then Prabu stored them in a special room. Some times he would 
take them to give to his people who needed it. Prabu only took a few 
gold and jewels. Then he brought them to a goldsmith. “Please make a 
necklace for my daughter,” said Prabu. “My pleasure, Your Majesty,” the 
goldsmith replied. The goldsmith worked with all his heart and his 
ability. He wanted to create the most beautiful necklace for the 
princess. 

                    
    The birthday came. People 
gathered in the palace field. Then Prabu and the queen appeared. They 
waved to their beloved people. Cheers were loud and louder when the 
princess appeared. Everybody admired her beauty. Prabu got up from his 
chair and took a small pillow. A beautiful necklace was on the pillow. 
Prabu took that necklace. “My beloved daughter, today I give this 
necklace to you. This necklace is a gift from people in this country. 
They love you so much. They presented it for you to express their 
happiness, because you have growing to a woman,” said Prabu. The 
princess accepted the necklace. She looked at the necklace in a glance. 
“I don’t want this necklace! It’s ugly!” shouted the princess as she 
threw the necklace away. The necklace hit the floor and was broken. The 
gold and jewels were spread out on the floor. 

                    
 No body dared to speak. They 
never thought that their beloved princess would do such a cruel thing. 
In their silence, people heard the queen crying. Every woman felt sad 
and began crying too. Then everybody was crying. Suddenly, from the 
middle of the field, a spring emerged. It quickly became a pool. The 
palace was getting flooded. Soon the place became a big lake. 

                    
    Nowadays the water on that lake 
is not as full as before. There is only a small lake now. People called 
the lake Telaga Warna (it means lake of colour). On a bright day, the 
lake is full of colour. These colors come from the reflections of 
forest, plants, flowers, and sky around the lake. But some people said 
that the colours are from the princess’ necklace, which spreads at the 
bottom of the lake.***<br />The Legend of the Pineapple FruitThere was a pretty little girl called Pina who was pampered by her mother as an only child. Everything that Pina asked for, Pina got. Everything that Pina scoffed at was taken away. No one in her village was ever so spoiled as Pina. No one was ever such a snobbish child. She was so lazy, and she had never stirred a finger to work in her life.Pina’s mother was perfectly happy that way, for Pina remained dependent on her as a spoiled child. But one day, Pina’s mother fell ill and there was no one to take care of Pina. She resolved that she would get well immediately for Pina’s sake – but she knew she would need help."Pina, Pina," she called weakly, from her cot. "Come here a moment. I have something to ask of you."Pina had never been asked to do anything in her life, and she was quite prepared to refuse, but she said anyway, "What is it, Mother?""Pina," said the doting mother, "I am too sick to make you anything to eat. I am too sick to eat anything solid. I need you to cook lugaw for me, Pina. It is very easy: just put some rice in a pot, pour some water in with it, add a pinch of sugar, and leave the mixture to boil for a while.""Oh, that’s too hard! I won’t do it," Pina said firmly."You have to, Pina!" her mother pleaded. "What will your poor Nanay eat?"But Pina was immovable. At length her mother resorted to shouting if only to catch her attention. Moping, Pina dragged her heavy feet down the stairs to gather the things she needed to make lugaw. She managed to find the rice, the water, the bowl, the sugar – but she could not find the ladle anywhere. How was she supposed to cook lugaw without a ladle?"Nanay, where is the ladle?" Pina shouted."It is beside the other kitchen utensils, Pina, you know where I keep them," her mother weakly shouted back.But the ladle was not anywhere near the other kitchen utensils, and Pina was too lazy to look for it elsewhere. "I can’t find the ladle, mother," she complained. "I guess I won’t be cooking without the ladle.""Oh, you lazy child," Pina’s mother wept. "You won’t even look! I hope you grow a thousand eyes so you’ll be able to find it!" After saying these words, Pina’s mother noticed that the house had fallen silent. Pina was no longer griping downstairs! That was a marvel. Perhaps she was already cooking. Pina’s mother would be happy if the child would cook her anything, even if it were burnt.But a long time had passed, and still the house was silent, and still Pina’s mother could not smell the cooking coals burning. She began to get worried. With all her meager strength she called out for Pina. Pina did not come, but the neighbors heard her pitiful cries, and they decided to drop by to see what was wrong. They took care of Pina’s mother in the child’s place."Where is Pina?" Pina’s mother asked at once. "Where is my child?""Oh, you know that girl," they assured her, "she must be in some friend’s house, having a good time. She hates responsibility. She may only be a little angry at you because you had asked her to work. It will pass, and she will come home."Pina’s mother rested easily with that thought, and she recovered quickly. But she was up and about and asking all around town for her precious little child, and still Pina had not returned.One sunny day, while Pina’s mother was cleaning their back yard, she saw a strange yellow fruit about as large as the head of a child that had sprung up from the ground. "How curious!" she thought, and bent to examine it. The strange, spiny yellow fruit, she saw, had a thousand black eyes."A thousand eyes...!" she gasped, remembering a mother’s curse carelessly let out. "My Pina!"But there was nothing to be done. Imagine a thousand black eyes and not one of them seeing, and not one of them being able to shed a tear. Pina’s mother, who still loved the child more than anything in the world, decided to honor her memory by taking the seeds of the strange yellow fruit and planting them. When after a while there was more of the fruit, Pina’s mother gave her harvest away to everyone she knew. Thus Pina, in another form, became generous to others.To this day the Filipinos call the yellow fruit pinya, after the pretty spoiled child.<br />

New areas or new hamlets are named "Pangkalan Balai" (estimated to be around the lower reaches of Simpit Now). This new area was used as a residential area and as a rice field in the Pang Sako area. Thus the name of the hamlet becomes 2 (two), namely the Suak Hamlet and Pangkalan Balai Hamlet and is still headed by the hamlet chief named Sahmad Bin Sahaji (Puyang Depati) and named as Gindo.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the 17th century AD, the sultanate was established in Palembang, Palembang Darussalam, with the establishment of the sultanate, which also influenced the development of hamlets within the Southern Sumatra region including Jambi, Lampung and Bengkulu. At that time the area included in the auspices of the Sultanate of Palembang lived in harmony, safe and peaceful. The first Sultan was Abdurrahman with the title Sultan Abdurrahman Amirul Mukmini Sayyidul Imam, then went down to his son, Sultan Manssur, and then his grandson, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin. In connection with the period of the Sultanate, a government called the Kadipaten Pedatuan, Gindo, Penggawo and in the field of religion there were also terms called Penghulu, Ketip, Mudin, Lebai and Hulubalang.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Sultan's era to (3) three in the form of a rock. This union is in charge of heading several pengandeng villages, as the surrender of the Sultan's government extension in the area with the term Marga, Pesiren power from the Sultanate to the clan government at that time, then Puyang Depati Sahmad Bin Sahaji was appointed by the Sultan to establish a clan namely Malay Mantam with the center of government is in Sekayu. Long before Puyang Depati (Sahmad Bin Sahaji) was appointed to be Datuk and moved from Soak Hamlet to Pangkalan Balai, that in the city of Sekayu there was a rice field called the community with the term Pang Sako rice fields and in the downstream called Pang Sambut rice fields. The rice fields are cultivated by the people of Soak and Pangkalan Balai villages every year, in cultivating paddy fields there is often a commotion between the residents of these two hamlets and always the reconciling Puyang Depati.
</p><p>
</p><p>During that time there was a child from the lineage of Sahmad Bin Sahaji (Puyang Depati), Sahmad had a younger sister named Sajidin, Sajidin had a child named Tahaji, Tahaji had three daughters named: Tasaima, Tasaiyah, Sak Ayu (Silsila family attached) . Of the three most beautiful Tahaji Bin Sajidin's daughters, Sak Ayu. Sak Ayu often follows her parents to the fields and when the harvest gets a lot. As adults mature, Sak Ayu is rarely invited by her parents to the bottom, so in reality the harvest is reduced, this is always considered by her parents, including local residents.
</p><p>
</p><p>The mother of three daughters named Mahesa Binti Madaru once dreamed that one of her children had Tuah Padi and the dream was told to Puyang Depati. Puyang Depati begged for guidance from the Almighty God about the truth of his wife's dream about her three daughters, and it turned out that the daughter who took the Padi was Sak Ayu, the youngest daughter of Puyang's drought.
</p><p>
</p><p>Since then the community believes that if they want to harvest successfully they should take Sak Ayu down to the bottom to lower the seeds and ask to be prayed so that the seeds planted will avoid disease and bear fruit. Eventually this story spread throughout the hamlet and until now people still believe in this rice dish.
</p><p>
</p><p>The entire Pang Sako rice field every year managed to harvest abundantly and many people thanked Sak Ayu. The community felt the benefits so that Pang Sako's rice fields were known by the community as the spirit of Sakayu's women's rice, and over time the area continued to grow and houses were built around the banks of the Musi river, starting from around the Simpit Canal to the upper reaches.
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1745 AD the community began to build a lot of houses and open the rice fields, so the name Dusun Pangkalan Balai and Dusun Soak were renamed by Puyang Depati to Sak Ayu or Sekayu. After Puyang Depati was appointed as the leader of the clan, namely the Marga Mantri Melayu, the capital of the clan was named "Sakayu", gradually the community began to call the clan capital become Sekayu.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sahmad Bin Tahaji (Puyang Depati) has powers such as: can call from a distance, can reduce rain, experts in the field of religion and in the field of medicine. Sahmad Bin Tahaji (Puyang Depati) was also elected</p><br />

Malin Kundang and his mother had to live hard because his father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sell the caught fish in the town. One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant’s ship being raided by a band of pirates. With his bravery, Malin Kundang helped the merchant defeat the pirates. To thank him, the merchant allowed Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin Kundang agreed in the hope to get a better life. He left his mother alone. Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and a lot of crews who worked loading trading goods. He was also married to a beautiful woman. When he was sailing on his trading journey, his ship landed on a coast near a small village. The local people recognized that it was Malin Kundang, a boy from the area. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”. An old woman, who was Malin Kundang’s mother, ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She wanted to hug him to release her sadness of being lonely after a long time. When his mother came near him, Malin Kundang who was with his beautiful wife and his ship crews denied that she was his mother. She had pleaded Malin Kundang to look at her and admit that she was her mother. But he kept refusing to do it and yelling at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!” After that he ordered his crews to set sail to leave the old woman who was then full of sadness and anger. Finally, feeling enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize to her. Malin Kundang just laughed and set sail. Suddenly a thunderstorm came in the quiet sea, wrecking his huge ship. He was thrown out to a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse, he had turned into a stone.</p><p></p><p>------------------------</p><p></p><p>Indonesian Translation </p><p>LEGENDA MALIN KUNDANG</p><p></p><p>Dahulu kala, di sebuah desa kecil dekat pantai di Sumatra Barat tinggal seorang wanita dan putranya, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang dan ibunya harus hidup keras karena ayahnya telah meninggal ketika dia masih bayi. Malin Kundang adalah anak yang sehat, rajin, dan kuat. Dia biasanya pergi ke laut untuk menangkap ikan. Setelah mendapatkan ikan, ia akan membawanya ke ibunya, atau menjual ikan yang ditangkap itu di kota. Suatu hari, ketika Malin Kundang berlayar, dia melihat kapal pedagang diserbu oleh sekelompok perompak. Dengan keberaniannya, Malin Kundang membantu pedagang mengalahkan para perompak. Untuk berterima kasih padanya, pedagang itu mengizinkan Malin Kundang untuk berlayar bersamanya. Malin Kundang setuju dengan harapan untuk mendapatkan kehidupan yang lebih baik.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The story of Garuda birth and deeds is told in the first book of the great epic Mahabharata. According to the epic, when Garuda first burst forth from his egg, he appeared as a raging inferno equal to the cosmic conflagration that consumes the world at the end of every age. Frightened, the gods begged him for mercy. Garuda, hearing their plea, reduced himself in size and energy.
</p><p>Garuda father was the creator-rishi Kasyapa. His mother was Vinata, whose sister was Kadru, the mother of serpents. One day, Vinata entered into and lost a foolish bet, as a result of which she became enslaved to her sister.
</p><p>Mahabharata mentions about a bet between sisters and wives of Kashyapa, Vinata and Kadru, about the colour of Uchchaihshravas tail. While Vinata, the mother of Garuda and Aruna, said it was white, Kadru said it was black. The loser would have to serve as a servant of the winner. Kadru told her sons, Naga (“serpent”), to cover the tail of the horse and thus make it appear as black in colour and thus, Kadru won.
</p><p>Resolving to release his mother from this state of bondage, Garuda approached the serpents and asked them what it would take to purchase her freedom. Their reply was that Garuda would have to bring them the elixir of immortality, also called amrita. It was a tall order. The amrita at that time found itself in the possession of the gods, who guarded it jealously, since it was the source of their immortality. They had ringed the elixir with a massive fire that covered the sky. They had blocked the way to the elixir with a fierce mechanical contraption of sharp rotating blades. And finally, they had stationed two gigantic poisonous snakes next to the elixir as deadly guardians.
</p><p>Undaunted, Garuda hastened toward the abode of the gods intent on robbing them of their treasure. Knowing of his design, the gods met him in full battle-array. Garuda, however, defeated the entire host and scattered them in all directions. Taking the water of many rivers into his mouth, he extinguished the protective fire the gods had thrown up. Reducing his size, he crept past the rotating blades of their murderous machine. And finally, he mangled the two gigantic serpents they had posted as guards. Taking the elixir into his mouth without swallowing it, he launched again into the air and headed toward the eagerly waiting serpents.
</p><p>En route, he encountered Vishnu. Rather than fight, the two exchanged promises. Vishnu promised Garuda the gift of immortality even without drinking from the elixir, and Garuda promised to become Vishnu mount.
</p><p>Flying onward, he met Indra the god of the sky. Another exchange of promises occurred. Garuda promised that once he had delivered the elixir, thus fulfilling the request of the serpents, he would make it possible for Indra to regain possession of the elixir and to take it back to the gods. Indra in turn promised Garuda the serpents as food.
</p><p>At long last, Garuda alighted in front of the waiting serpents. Placing the elixir on the grass, and thereby liberating his mother Vinata from her servitude, he urged the serpents to perform their religious ablutions before consuming it. As they hurried off to do so, Indra swooped in to make off with the elixir.
</p><p>From that day onward, Garuda was the ally of the gods and the trusty mount of Vishnu, as well as the implacable enemy of snakes, upon whom he preyed at every opportunity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Suatu yg dpt di lakukan oleh legends yg terluas biasa</p><br />

The outbreak of the Klungkung War destroyed such a small country. The king of Klungkung was killed on the battlefield, yet his daughter and son were able to escape and hide in the jungle.</p><p>One day, Raden Banterang and his commanders were inspecting his district while hunting. It was in the jungle that Raden Banterang met a beautiful lady named Ida Ayu Surati. She was then taken to Blambangan to be his wife. Raden Banterang and Ida Ayu Surati enjoyed a happy life in the palace.</p><p>When Raden Banterang was hunting one day, the lonely princess was surprised by the arrival of a dirty beggar asking for her pity. The princess was surprised to find that the beggar was her older brother, Agung Bagus Mantra. She promptly squatted and embraced her brother's legs. However, her great respect of her brother was not well accepted. Instead, she was tortured for she supposedly betrayed her noble family.</p><p>Agung Bagus Mantra asked his sister to kill Raden Banterang, but such a request was rejected. He was very angry with her and came up with a sly idea to slander Raden Banterang.</p><p>At first, Raden Banterang did not believe that his wife had been involved in a scandal with another man. Yet because of Agung's convincing words, he was finally influenced and therefore, his wife was dragged down to a small lake. Asking for compassion, Ida Ayu Surati tried to tell the truth and denied her husband’s accusation. Hearing his wife's explanation, the king became angrier and angrier. As a proof of her sacred love, she asked her husband to kill her. As a last request, she asked her husband to throw her dead body into the river. She said that if the water in the river smelled terrible, it meant that she had ever been sinful, but if it smelled fragrant it meant that she was innocent.<br />Raden Banterang who was unable to control his emotions, soon stabbed his keris (dagger) into his wife's chest. She died instantly. The dead body of Ida Ayu Surati was quickly thrown into the dirty river. Raden Banterang was shocked to see the river suddenly become clean and as clear as glass with a fragrant smell. Raden Banterang screamed crazily and regretted his deed. He walked unsteadily and fell into the river screaming, "Banyuwangi, Banyuwangi, Banyuwangi!”</p><p>Another legend of Banyuwangi was taken from the story of Sri Tanjung Sidopekso. Once upon a time, a local ruler, King Sulahkromo, had a patih, R.Sidopekso. The wife of the patih, Sri Tanjung, was so beautiful that the king desired her. In order to be able to seduce Sri Tanjung, the king ordered his patih on a mission that would take a long time to accomplish. During his absence, the king tried to court Sri Tanjung without success. When R. Sidopekso returned, he went first to his ruler. The king, angry that his scheme had not succeeded, told the patih that during his absence his wife had been unfaithful to him. Sidopekso went home and confronted his wife with her alleged adultery. Her denial did not convince him, and he announced that he was going to kill her. Sidopekso brought Sri Tanjung to the bank of the river. Before he stabbed her to death, she prophesied that her innocence would be proven. And indeed, after having stabbed his wife to death and having thrown the dead body into the dirty river, the river immediately became clean and began to spread a wonderful fragrance. Sidopekso said, “Banyu ... Wangi..... Banyuwangi”. This means "fragrant water ". BANYUWANGI was born from the proof of noble and sacred love.</p><br />

Her daughter was very beautiful, but she had very bad behavior. She never helped her mother to work. The girl just spent her time to beautify herself and admire her beauty in the mirror every day, while her mother had to work hard to earn a living to support their life. Besides lazy, she was also very spoiled. She would cry if she wasn't given something that she asked. Of course, that situation made her mother sad but somehow she still loved her daughter.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, the girl asked her mother to buy new gown for her. Her mother rejected her request at first because she did not have enough money. But, her mother was forced to obey her request, so she fulfilled her daughter request in the end. Then her mother asked her daughter to accompany her to the market. “All right, but I do not want to walk beside you. You had to walk behind me, because I will be embarrassed if others see me “she said. Although her mother was sad, she continued to obey her request. So they went to the market to buy her daughter a new gown. The girl was walking in front while her mother was walking behind her and carrying a basket on their way to the market.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although they were a mother and a daughter, they looked very different. They did not look like they came from the same family. They even looked like a boss and a servant. How couldn’t be like that? Her daughter dressed up beautifully and wore a very nice gown. While her mother looked old and wore very simple dress.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the way to the market, There was a man greeting them. “Hey pretty girl, is she your mother?” asked the man.  “Of course she is not my mother. She is my maid, “said the girl. His mother felt so sad to hear her answer. But she was silent although her heart was crying. Along the street people kept asking the beautiful girl about her mother. But the girl always said that the old woman behind her was her maid.</p><p>
</p><p>In the end, the mother could not stand any longer to hear the answer that comes out of her daughter mouth. Then she prayed to god “Lord, please punish this ungrateful child,” she said. After saying this, the girl’s legs immediately turned to be stone. The change came slowly from her feet up to her head. Seeing his legs turned to be a stone, the girl screamed “oh no! What happened to my legs?” She shouted. Then she cried and realized that she had treated her mother badly. “Mom,! Forgive me. Please forgive me! “She cried in panic. The girl kept crying and begging for her mother's forgiveness but it was too late. Her whole body eventually became a stone. Her mother was sad to see what happened to her daughter but she could not do anything else. Although she had completely become a stone, people can still see her tears. That is the reason why the stone named Batu Menangis.</p><br /><p>Mudah-mudahan jawaban diatas dapat membantu menjawab pertanyaanmu.</p><br /><br /><p>Detil tambahan:</p><p>Kelas: SMA</p><p>Pelajaran: bahasa inggris</p><p>Kategori: narrative text</p><br />
